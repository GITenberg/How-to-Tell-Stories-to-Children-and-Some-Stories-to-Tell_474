    <h2><a name="Page_5"
       id="Page_5"></a>PREFACE</h2>

    <p>The stories which are given in the following pages are for
    the most part those which I have found to be best liked by the
    children to whom I have told these and others. I have tried to
    reproduce the form in which I actually tell
    them,&mdash;although that inevitably varies with every
    repetition,&mdash;feeling that it would be of greater value to
    another story-teller than a more closely literary form.</p>

    <p>For the same reason, I have confined my statements of theory
    as to method, to those which reflect my own experience; my
    "rules" were drawn from introspection and retrospection, at the
    urging of others, long after the instinctive method they
    exemplify had become habitual.</p>

    <p>These facts are the basis of my hope that the book may be of
    use to those who have much to do with children.</p>

    <p>It would be impossible, in the space of any pardonable
    preface, to name the teachers, mothers, and librarians who have
    given me hints and helps during the past few years of
    story-telling. But I cannot let these pages go to press without
    recording my especial indebted<a name="Page_6"
       id="Page_6"></a>ness to the few persons without whose
       interested aid the little book would scarcely have come to
       be. They are: Mrs Elizabeth Young Rutan, at whose generous
       instance I first enlarged my own field of entertaining
       story-telling to include hers, of educational narrative, and
       from whom I had many valuable suggestions at that time; Miss
       Ella L. Sweeney, assistant superintendent of schools,
       Providence, R.I., to whom I owe exceptional opportunities
       for investigation and experiment; Mrs Root, children's
       librarian of Providence Public Library, and Miss Alice M.
       Jordan, Boston Public Library, children's room, to whom I am
       indebted for much gracious and efficient aid.</p>

    <p>My thanks are due also to Mr David Nutt for permission to
    make use of three stories from <i>English Fairy Tales</i>, by
    Mr Joseph Jacobs, and <i>Raggylug</i>, from <i>Wild Animals I
    have Known</i>, by Mr Ernest Thompson Seton; to Messrs
    Frederick A. Stokes Company for <i>Five Little White Heads</i>,
    by Walter Learned, and for <i>Bird Thoughts</i>; to Messrs
    Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr&uuml;bner &amp; Co. Ltd. for <i>The
    Burning of the Ricefields</i>, from <i>Gleanings in
    Buddha-Fields</i>, by Mr Lafcadio Hearn; to Messrs H.R.
    Allenson Ltd. for three stories from <i>The Golden Windows</i>,
    by Miss Laura E. Richards; and to Mr Seumas McManus for
    <i>Billy Beg and his Bull</i>, from <i>In Chimney
    Corners</i>.</p>

    <p>Not long ago, I chanced to open a magazine at a story of
    Italian life which dealt with a curious popular custom. It told
    of the love of the people for the performances of a strangely
    clad, periodically appearing old man who was a professional
    story-teller. This old man repeated whole cycles of myth and
    serials of popular history, holding his audience-chamber in
    whatever corner of the open court or square he happened upon,
    and always surrounded by an eager crowd of listeners. So great
    was the respect in which the story-teller was held, that any
    interruption was likely to be resented with violence.</p>

    <p>As I read of the absorbed silence and the changing
    expressions of the crowd about the old man, I was suddenly
    reminded of a company of people I had recently seen. They were
    gathered in one of the parlours of a women's college, and their
    serious young faces had, habitually, none of the childlike
    responsiveness of the Italian populace; they were suggestive,
    rather, of a daily experience which precluded over-much
    surprise or curiosity about anything.<a name="Page_12"
       id="Page_12"></a> In the midst of the group stood a
       frail-looking woman with bright eyes. She was telling a
       story, a children's story, about a good and a bad little
       mouse.</p>

    <p>She had been asked to do that thing, for a purpose, and she
    did it, therefore. But it was easy to see from the expressions
    of the listeners how trivial a thing it seemed to them.</p>

    <p>That was at first. But presently the room grew quieter; and
    yet quieter. The faces relaxed into amused smiles, sobered in
    unconscious sympathy, finally broke in ripples of mirth. The
    story-teller had come to her own.</p>

    <p>The memory of the college girls listening to the mouse-story
    brought other memories with it. Many a swift composite view of
    faces passed before my mental vision, faces with the child's
    look on them, yet not the faces of children. And of the
    occasions to which the faces belonged, those were most vivid
    which were earliest in my experience. For it was those early
    experiences which first made me realise the modern
    possibilities of the old, old art of telling stories.</p>

    <p>It had become a part of my work, some years ago, to give
    English lectures on German literature. Many of the members of
    my class were unable to read in the original the works with
    which I dealt, and as these were modern works it was rarely
    possible to obtain translations.<a name="Page_13"
       id="Page_13"></a> For this reason, I gradually formed the
       habit of telling the story of the drama or novel in question
       before passing to a detailed consideration of it. I enjoyed
       this part of the lesson exceedingly, but it was some time
       before I realised how much the larger part of the lesson it
       had become to the class. They used&mdash;and they were
       mature women&mdash;to wait for the story as if it were a
       sugarplum and they, children; and to grieve openly if it
       were omitted. Substitution of reading from a translation was
       greeted with precisely the same abatement of eagerness that
       a child shows when he has asked you to tell a story, and you
       offer, instead, to "read one from the pretty book." And so
       general and constant were the tokens of enjoyment that there
       could ultimately be no doubt of the power which the mere
       story-telling exerted.</p>

    <p>The attitude of the grown-up listeners did but illustrate
    the general difference between the effect of telling a story
    and of reading one. Everyone who knows children well has felt
    the difference. With few exceptions, children listen twice as
    eagerly to a story told as to one read, and even a "recitation"
    or a so-called "reading" has not the charm for them that the
    person wields who can "tell a story." And there are sound
    reasons for their preference.</p>

    <p>The great difference, including lesser ones,
    <a name="Page_14"
       id="Page_14"></a>between telling and reading is that the
       teller is free; the reader is bound. The book in hand, or
       the wording of it in mind, binds the reader. The
       story-teller is bound by nothing; he stands or sits, free to
       watch his audience, free to follow or lead every changing
       mood, free to use body, eyes, voice, as aids in expression.
       Even his mind is unbound, because he lets the story come in
       the words of the moment, being so full of what he has to
       say. For this reason, a story told is more spontaneous than
       one read, however well read. And, consequently, the
       connection with the audience is closer, more electric, than
       is possible when the book or its wording intervenes.</p>

    <p>Beyond this advantage, is the added charm of the personal
    element in story-telling. When you make a story your own and
    tell it, the listener gets the story, <i>plus your appreciation
    of it</i>. It comes to him filtered through your own enjoyment.
    That is what makes the funny story thrice funnier on the lips
    of a jolly raconteur than in the pages of a memoir. It is the
    filter of personality. Everybody has something of the curiosity
    of the primitive man concerning his neighbour; what another has
    in his own person felt and done has an especial hold on each
    one of us. The most cultured of audiences will listen to the
    personal reminiscences of an explorer with a different tingle
    of interest from that which it feels for a
    scien<a name="Page_15"
       id="Page_15"></a>tific lecture on the results of the
       exploration. The longing for the personal in experience is a
       very human longing. And this instinct or longing is
       especially strong in children. It finds expression in their
       delight in tales of what father or mother did when they were
       little, of what happened to grandmother when she went on a
       journey, and so on, but it also extends to stories which are
       not in themselves personal: which take their personal savour
       merely from the fact that they flow from the lips in
       spontaneous, homely phrases, with an appreciative gusto
       which suggests participation.</p>

    <p>The greater ease in holding the attention of children is,
    for teachers, a sufficient practical reason for telling stories
    rather than reading them. It is incomparably easier to make the
    necessary exertion of "magnetism," or whatever it may be
    called, when nothing else distracts the attention. One's eyes
    meet the children's gaze naturally and constantly; one's
    expression responds to and initiates theirs without effort; the
    connection is immediate. For the ease of the teacher, then, no
    less than for the joy of the children, may the art of
    story-telling be urged as pre-eminent over the art of
    reading.</p>

    <p>It is a very old, a very beautiful art. Merely to think of
    it carries one's imaginary vision to scenes of glorious and
    touching antiquity.<a name="Page_16"
       id="Page_16"></a> The tellers of the stories of which
       Homer's <i>Iliad</i> was compounded; the transmitters of the
       legend and history which make up the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>;
       the travelling raconteurs whose brief heroic tales are woven
       into our own national epic; the grannies of age-old
       tradition whose stories are parts of Celtic folk-lore, of
       Germanic myth, of Asiatic wonder-tales,&mdash;these are but
       younger brothers and sisters to the generations of
       story-tellers whose inventions are but vaguely outlined in
       resultant forms of ancient literatures, and the names of
       whose tribes are no longer even guessed. There was a time
       when story-telling was the chiefest of the arts of
       entertainment; kings and warriors could ask for nothing
       better; serfs and children were satisfied with nothing less.
       In all times there have been occasional revivals of this
       pastime, and in no time has the art died out in the simple
       human realms of which mothers are queens. But perhaps never,
       since the really old days, has story-telling so nearly
       reached a recognised level of dignity as a legitimate and
       general art of entertainment as now.</p>

    <p>Its present popularity seems in a way to be an outgrowth of
    the recognition of its educational value which was given
    impetus by the German pedagogues of Froebel's school. That
    recognition has, at all events, been a noticeable factor in
    educational conferences of late.<a name="Page_17"
       id="Page_17"></a> The function of the story is no longer
       considered solely in the light of its place in the
       kindergarten; it is being sought in the first, the second,
       and indeed in every standard where the children are still
       children. Sometimes the demand for stories is made solely in
       the interests of literary culture, sometimes in far ampler
       and vaguer relations, ranging from inculcation of scientific
       fact to admonition of moral theory; but whatever the reason
       given, the conclusion is the same: tell the children
       stories.</p>

    <p>The average teacher has yielded to the pressure, at least in
    theory. Cheerfully, as she has already accepted so many
    modifications of old methods by "new thought," she accepts the
    idea of instilling mental and moral desiderata into the
    receptive pupil, <i>vi&acirc;</i> the charming tale. But,
    confronted with the concrete problem of what desideratum by
    which tale, and how, the average teacher sometimes finds her
    cheerfulness displaced by a sense of inadequacy to the
    situation.</p>

    <p>People who have always told stories to children, who do not
    know when they began or how they do it; whose heads are stocked
    with the accretions of years of fairyland-dwelling and
    nonsense-sharing,&mdash;these cannot understand the perplexity
    of one to whom the gift and the opportunity have not "come
    <a name="Page_18"
       id="Page_18"></a>natural." But there are many who can
       understand it, personally and all too well. To these, the
       teachers who have not a knack for story-telling, who feel as
       shy as their own youngest scholar at the thought of it, who
       do not know where the good stories are, or which ones are
       easy to tell, it is my earnest hope that the following pages
       will bring something definite and practical in the way of
       suggestion and reference.</p>

    <p>Let us first consider together the primary matter of the
    <i>aim</i> in educational story-telling. On our conception of
    this must depend very largely all decisions as to choice and
    method; and nothing in the whole field of discussion is more
    vital than a just and sensible notion of this first point. What
    shall we attempt to accomplish by stories in the schoolroom?
    What can we reasonably expect to accomplish? And what, of this,
    is best accomplished by this means and no other?</p>

    <p>These are questions which become the more interesting and
    practical because the recent access of enthusiasm for stories
    in education has led many people to claim very wide and very
    vaguely outlined territory for their possession, and often to
    lay heaviest stress on their least essential functions. The
    most important instance of this is the fervour with which many
    compilers of stories for school <a name="Page_20"
       id="Page_20"></a>use have directed their efforts solely
       toward illustration of natural phenomena. Geology, zoology,
       botany, and even physics are taught by means of more or less
       happily constructed narratives based on the simpler facts of
       these sciences. Kindergarten teachers are familiar with such
       narratives: the little stories of chrysalis-breaking,
       flower-growth, and the like. Now this is a perfectly proper
       and practicable aim, but it is not a primary one. Others, to
       which at best this is but secondary, should have first place
       and receive greatest attention.</p>

    <p>What is a story, essentially? Is it a text-book of science,
    an appendix to the geography, an introduction to the primer of
    history? Of course it is not. A story is essentially and
    primarily a work of art, and its chief function must be sought
    in the line of the uses of art. Just as the drama is capable of
    secondary uses, yet fails abjectly to realise its purpose when
    those are substituted for its real significance as a work of
    art, so does the story lend itself to subsidiary purposes, but
    claims first and most strongly to be recognised in its real
    significance as a work of art. Since the drama deals with life
    in all its parts, it can exemplify sociological theory, it can
    illustrate economic principle, it can even picture politics;
    but the drama which does these things only, has no breath of
    its real life in its being, and dies <a name="Page_21"
       id="Page_21"></a>when the wind of popular tendency veers
       from its direction. So, you can teach a child interesting
       facts about bees and butterflies by telling him certain
       stories, and you can open his eyes to colours and processes
       in nature by telling certain others; but unless you do
       something more than that and before that, you are as one who
       should use the Venus of Milo for a demonstration in
       anatomy.</p>

    <p>The message of the story is the message of beauty, as
    effective as that message in marble or paint. Its part in the
    economy of life is <i>to give joy</i>. And the purpose and
    working of the joy is found in that quickening of the spirit
    which answers every perception of the truly beautiful in the
    arts of man. To give joy; in and through the joy to stir and
    feed the life of the spirit: is not this the legitimate
    function of the story in education?</p>

    <p>Because I believe it to be such, not because I ignore the
    value of other uses, I venture to push aside all aims which
    seem secondary to this for later mention under specific heads.
    Here in the beginning of our consideration I wish to emphasise
    this element alone. A story is a work of art. Its greatest use
    to the child is in the everlasting appeal of beauty by which
    the soul of man is constantly pricked to new hungers, quickened
    to new perceptions, and so given desire to grow.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_22"
       id="Page_22"></a>The obvious practical bearing of this is
       that story-telling is first of all an art of entertainment;
       like the stage, its immediate purpose is the pleasure of the
       hearer,&mdash;his pleasure, not his instruction, first.</p>

    <p>Now the story-teller who has given the listening children
    such pleasure as I mean may or may not have added a fact to the
    content of their minds; she has inevitably added something to
    the vital powers of their souls. She has given a wholesome
    exercise to the emotional muscles of the spirit, has opened up
    new windows to the imagination, and added some line or colour
    to the ideal of life and art which is always taking form in the
    heart of a child. She has, in short, accomplished the one
    greatest aim of story-telling,&mdash;to enlarge and enrich the
    child's spiritual experience, and stimulate healthy reaction
    upon it.</p>

    <p>Of course this result cannot be seen and proved as easily
    and early as can the apprehension of a fact. The most one can
    hope to recognise is its promise, and this is found in the
    tokens of that genuine pleasure which is itself the means of
    accomplishment. It is, then, the signs of right pleasure which
    the story-teller must look to for her guide, and which it must
    be her immediate aim to evoke. As for the recognition of the
    signs,&mdash;no one who has ever seen the delight of a real
    child <a name="Page_23"
       id="Page_23"></a>over a real story can fail to know the
       signals when given, or flatter himself into belief in them
       when absent.</p>

    <p>Intimately connected with the enjoyment given are two very
    practically beneficial results which the story-teller may hope
    to obtain, and at least one of which will be a kind of reward
    to herself. The first is a relaxation of the tense schoolroom
    atmosphere, valuable for its refreshing recreative power. The
    second result, or aim, is not so obvious, but is even more
    desirable; it is this: story-telling is at once one of the
    simplest and quickest ways of establishing a happy relation
    between teacher and children, and one of the most effective
    methods of forming the habit of fixed attention in the
    latter.</p>

    <p>If you have never seen an indifferent child aroused or a
    hostile one conquered to affection by a beguiling tale, you can
    hardly appreciate the truth of the first statement; but nothing
    is more familiar in the story-teller's experience. An amusing,
    but&mdash;to me&mdash;touching experience recently reaffirmed
    in my mind this power of the story to establish friendly
    relations.</p>

    <p>My three-year-old niece, who had not seen me since her
    babyhood, being told that Aunt Sara was coming to visit her,
    somehow confused the expected guest with a more familiar aunt,
    my sister. At sight of me, her rush of welcome relapsed into a
    puzzled and hurt withdrawal, <a name="Page_24"
       id="Page_24"></a>which yielded to no explanations or
       proffers of affection. All the first day she followed me
       about at a wistful distance, watching me as if I might at
       any moment turn into the well-known and beloved relative I
       ought to have been. Even by undressing time I had not
       progressed far enough to be allowed intimate approach to
       small sacred nightgowns and diminutive shirts. The next
       morning, when I opened the door of the nursery where her
       maid was brushing her hair, the same dignity radiated from
       the little round figure perched on its high chair, the same
       almost hostile shyness gazed at me from the great expressive
       eyes. Obviously, it was time for something to be done.</p>

    <p>Disregarding my lack of invitation, I drew up a stool, and
    seating myself opposite the small unbending person, began in a
    conversational murmur: "M&mdash;m, I guess those are
    tingly-tanglies up there in that curl Lottie's combing; did you
    ever hear about the tingly-tanglies? They live in little girls'
    hair, and they aren't any bigger than <i>that</i>, and when
    anybody tries to comb the hair they curl both weeny legs round,
    <i>so</i>, and hold on tight with both weeny hands, <i>so</i>,
    and won't let go!" As I paused, my niece made a queer little
    sound indicative of query battling with reserve. I pursued the
    subject: "They like best to live right over a little girl's
    ear, or down in her neck, <a name="Page_25"
       id="Page_25"></a>because it is easier to hang on, there;
       tingly-tanglies are very smart, indeed."</p>

    <p>"What's ti-ly-ta-lies?" asked a curious, guttural little
    voice.</p>

    <p>I explained the nature and genesis of tingly-tanglies, as
    revealed to me some decades before by my inventive mother, and
    proceeded to develop their simple adventures. When next I
    paused the small guttural voice demanded, "Say more," and I
    joyously obeyed.</p>

    <p>When the curls were all curled and the last little button
    buttoned, my baby niece climbed hastily down from her chair,
    and deliberately up into my lap. With a caress rare to her
    habit she spoke my name, slowly and tentatively, "An-ty
    Sai-ry?" Then, in an assured tone, "Anty Sairy, I love you so
    much I don't know what to do!" And, presently, tucking a
    confiding hand in mine to lead me to breakfast, she explained
    sweetly, "I didn' know you when you comed las' night, but now I
    know you all th' time!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, blessed tale," thought I, "so easy a passport to a
    confidence so desired, so complete!" Never had the witchery of
    the story to the ear of a child come more closely home to me.
    But the fact of the witchery was no new experience. The
    surrender of the natural child to the story-teller is as
    absolute and invariable as that of a devotee to the priest of
    his own sect.</p>

    <p>This power is especially valuable in the case
    <a name="Page_26"
       id="Page_26"></a>of children whose natural shyness has been
       augmented by rough environment or by the strangeness of
       foreign habit. And with such children even more than with
       others it is also true that the story is a simple and
       effective means of forming the habit of concentration, of
       fixed attention; any teacher who deals with this class of
       children knows the difficulty of doing this fundamental and
       indispensable thing, and the value of any practical aid in
       doing it.</p>

    <p>More than one instance of the power of story-telling to
    develop attentiveness comes to my mind, but the most prominent
    in memory is a rather recent incident, in which the actors were
    boys and girls far past the child-stage of docility.</p>

    <p>I had been asked to tell stories to about sixty boys and
    girls of a club; the president warned me in her invitation that
    the children were exceptionally undisciplined, but my previous
    experiences with similar gatherings led me to interpret her
    words with a moderation which left me totally unready for the
    reality. When I faced my audience, I saw a squirming jumble of
    faces, backs of heads, and the various members of many small
    bodies,&mdash;not a person in the room was paying the slightest
    attention to me; the president's introduction could scarcely be
    said to succeed in interrupting the interchange of social
    amenities which was in progress, and which looked delusively
    like a <a name="Page_27"
       id="Page_27"></a>free fight. I came as near stage fright in
       the first minutes of that occasion as it is comfortable to
       be, and if it had not been impossible to run away I think I
       should not have remained. But I began, with as funny a tale
       as I knew, following the safe plan of not speaking very
       loudly, and aiming my effort at the nearest children. As I
       went on, a very few faces held intelligently to mine; the
       majority answered only fitfully; and not a few of my hearers
       conversed with their neighbours as if I were non-existent.
       The sense of bafflement, the futile effort, forced the
       perspiration to my hands and face&mdash;yet something in the
       faces before me told me that it was no ill-will that fought
       against me; it was the apathy of minds without the power or
       habit of concentration, unable to follow a sequence of ideas
       any distance, and rendered more restless by bodies which
       were probably uncomfortable, certainly undisciplined.</p>

    <p>The first story took ten minutes. When I began a second, a
    very short one, the initial work had to be done all over again,
    for the slight comparative quiet I had won had been totally
    lost in the resulting manifestation of approval.</p>

    <p>At the end of the second story, the room was really orderly
    to the superficial view, but where I stood I could see the
    small boy who deliberately made a hideous face at me each time
    my eyes met his, the two girls who talked <a name="Page_28"
       id="Page_28"></a>with their backs turned, the squirms of a
       figure here and there. It seemed so disheartening a record
       of failure that I hesitated much to yield to the uproarious
       request for a third story, but finally I did begin again, on
       a very long story which for its own sake I wanted them to
       hear.</p>

    <p>This time the little audience settled to attention almost at
    the opening words. After about five minutes I was suddenly
    conscious of a sense of ease and relief, a familiar restful
    feeling in the atmosphere; and then, at last, I knew that my
    audience was "with me," that they and I were interacting
    without obstruction. Absolutely quiet, entirely unconscious of
    themselves, the boys and girls were responding to every turn of
    the narrative as easily and readily as any group of story-bred
    kindergarten children. From then on we had a good time
    together.</p>

    <p>The process which took place in that small audience was a
    condensed example of what one may expect in habitual
    story-telling to a group of children. Once having had the
    attention chained by crude force of interest, the children
    begin to expect something interesting from the teacher, and to
    wait for it. And having been led step by step from one grade of
    a logical sequence to another, their minds&mdash;at first
    beguiled by the fascination of the steps&mdash;glide into the
    habit of following any logical sequence. My club formed its
    habit, as far as<a name="Page_29"
       id="Page_29"></a> I was concerned, all in one session; the
       ordinary demands of school procedure lengthen the process,
       but the result is equally sure. By the end of a week in
       which the children have listened happily to a story every
       day, the habit of listening and deducing has been formed,
       and the expectation of pleasantness is connected with the
       opening of the teacher's lips.</p>

    <p>These two benefits are well worth the trouble they cost, and
    for these two, at least, any teacher who tells a story well may
    confidently look&mdash;the quick gaining of a confidential
    relation with the children, and the gradual development of
    concentration and interested attention in them.</p>

    <p>These are direct and somewhat clearly discernible results,
    comfortably placed in a near future. There are other aims,
    reaching on into the far, slow modes of psychological growth,
    which must equally determine the choice of the story-teller's
    material and inform the spirit of her work. These other, less
    immediately attainable ends, I wish now to consider in relation
    to the different types of story by which they are severally
    best served.</p>

    <p>First, unbidden claimant of attention, comes</p>

    <p><b>THE FAIRY STORY</b></p>

    <p>No one can think of a child and a story, without thinking of
    the fairy tale. Is this, as <a name="Page_30"
       id="Page_30"></a>some would have us believe, a bad habit of
       an ignorant old world? Or can the Fairy Tale justify her
       popularity with truly edifying and educational results? Is
       she a proper person to introduce here, and what are her
       titles to merit?</p>

    <p>Oh dear, yes! Dame Fairy Tale comes bearing a magic wand in
    her wrinkled old fingers, with one wave of which she summons up
    that very spirit of joy which it is our chief effort to invoke.
    She raps smartly on the door, and open sesames echo to every
    imagination. Her red-heeled shoes twinkle down an endless lane
    of adventures, and every real child's footsteps quicken after.
    She is the natural, own great-grandmother of every child in the
    world, and her pocketfuls of treasures are his by right of
    inheritance. Shut her out, and you truly rob the children of
    something which is theirs; something marking their constant
    kinship with the race-children of the past, and adapted to
    their needs as it was to those of the generation of long ago!
    If there were no other criterion at all, it would be enough
    that the children love the fairy tale; we give them fairy
    stories, first, because they like them. But that by no means
    lessens the importance of the fact that fairy tales are also
    good for them.</p>

    <p>How good? In various ways. First, perhaps, in their supreme
    power of presenting truth through the guise of images. This is
    the way <a name="Page_31"
       id="Page_31"></a>the race-child took toward wisdom, and it
       is the way each child's individual instinct takes, after
       him. Elemental truths of moral law and general types of
       human experience are presented in the fairy tale, in the
       poetry of their images, and although the child is aware only
       of the image at the time, the truth enters with it and
       becomes a part of his individual experience, to be
       recognised in its relations at a later stage. Every truth
       and type so given broadens and deepens the capacity of the
       child's inner life, and adds an element to the store from
       which he draws his moral inferences.</p>

    <p>The most familiar instance of a moral truth conveyed under a
    fairy-story image is probably the story of the pure-hearted and
    loving girl whose lips were touched with the wonderful power of
    dropping jewels with every spoken word, while her stepsister,
    whose heart was infested with malice and evil desires, let ugly
    toads fall from her mouth whenever she spoke. I mention the old
    tale because there is probably no one of my readers who has not
    heard it in childhood, and because there are undoubtedly many
    to whose mind it has often recurred in later life as a sadly
    perfect presentment of the fact that "out of the abundance of
    the heart the mouth speaketh." That story has entered into the
    forming consciousness of many of us, with its implications of
    the inevitable result of visible <a name="Page_32"
       id="Page_32"></a>evil from evil in the heart, and its
       revelation of the loathsomeness of evil itself.</p>

    <p>And no less truly than this story has served to many as an
    embodiment of moral law has another household tale stood for a
    type of common experience. How much the poorer should we be,
    mentally, without our early prophecy of the "ugly ducklings" we
    are to meet later in life!&mdash;those awkward offspring of our
    little human duckyard who are mostly well kicked and buffeted
    about, for that very length of limb and breadth of back which
    needs must be, to support swan's wings. The story of the ugly
    duckling is much truer than many a bald statement of fact. The
    English-speaking world bears witness to its verity in constant
    use of the title as an identifying phrase: "It is the old story
    of the ugly duckling," we say, or "He has turned out a real
    ugly duckling." And we know that our hearers understand the
    whole situation.</p>

    <p>The consideration of such familiar types and expressions as
    that of the ugly duckling suggests immediately another good
    reason for giving the child his due of fairy lore. The reason
    is that to omit it is to deprive him of one important element
    in the full appreciation of mature literature. If one thinks of
    it, one sees that nearly all adult literature is made by people
    who, in their beginnings, were bred on the wonder tale. Whether
    he will or no, the grown-up <a name="Page_33"
       id="Page_33"></a>author must incorporate into his work the
       tendencies, memories, kinds of feeling which were his in
       childhood. The literature of maturity is, naturally,
       permeated by the influence of the literature of childhood.
       Sometimes it is apparent merely in the use of a name, as
       suggestive of certain kinds of experience; such are the
       recurrences of reference to the Cinderella story. Sometimes
       it is an allusion which has its strength in long association
       of certain qualities with certain characters in
       fairydom&mdash;like the slyness of Brother Fox, and the
       cruelty of Brother Wolf. Sometimes the association of ideas
       lies below the surface, drawing from the hidden wells of
       poetic illusion which are sunk in childhood. The man or
       woman whose infancy was nourished exclusively on tales
       adapted from science-made-easy, or from biographies of good
       men and great, must remain blind to these beauties of
       literature. He may look up the allusion, or identify the
       reference, but when that is done he is but richer by a fact
       or two; there is no remembered thrill in it for him, no
       savour in his memory, no suggestion to his imagination; and
       these are precisely the things which really count. Leaving
       out the fairy element is a loss to literary culture much as
       would be the omission of the Bible or of Shakespeare. Just
       as all adult literature is permeated by the influence of
       these, familiar in youth, so in less degree is it transfused
       with the <a name="Page_34"
       id="Page_34"></a>subtle reminiscences of childhood's
       commerce with the wonder world.</p>

    <p>To turn now from the inner to the outer aspects of the
    old-time tale is to meet another cause of its value to
    children. This is the value of its style. Simplicity,
    directness, and virility characterise the classic fairy tales
    and the most memorable relics of folklore. And these are three
    of the very qualities which are most seriously lacking in much
    of the new writing for children, and which are always necessary
    elements in the culture of taste. Fairy stories are not all
    well told, but the best fairy stories are supremely well told.
    And most folk-tales have a movement, a sweep, and an
    unaffectedness which make them splendid foundations for taste
    in style.</p>

    <p>For this, and for poetic presentation of truths in easily
    assimilated form, and because it gives joyous stimulus to the
    imagination, and is necessary to full appreciation of adult
    literature, we may freely use the wonder tale.</p>

    <p>Closely related to, sometimes identical with, the fairy tale
    is the old, old source of children's love and laughter,</p>

    <p><b>THE NONSENSE TALE</b></p>

    <p>Under this head I wish to include all the merely funny tales
    of childhood, embracing the <a name="Page_35"
       id="Page_35"></a>cumulative stories like that of the old
       woman and the pig which would not go over the stile. They
       all have a specific use and benefit, and are worth the
       repetition children demand for them. Their value lies, of
       course, in the tonic and relaxing properties of humour.
       Nowhere is that property more welcome or needed than in the
       schoolroom. It does us all good to laugh, if there is no
       sneer nor smirch in the laugh; fun sets the blood flowing
       more freely in the veins, and loosens the strained cords of
       feeling and thought; the delicious shock of surprise at
       every "funny spot" is a kind of electric treatment for the
       nerves. But it especially does us good to laugh when we are
       children. Every little body is released from the conscious
       control school imposes on it, and huddles into restful
       comfort or responds gaily to the joke.</p>

    <p>More than this, humour teaches children, as it does their
    grown-up brethren, some of the facts and proportions of life.
    What keener teacher is there than the kindly satire? "What more
    penetrating and suggestive than the humour of exaggerated
    statement of familiar tendency? Is there one of us who has not
    laughed himself out of some absurd complexity of over-anxiety
    with a sudden recollection of "clever Alice" and her fate? In
    our household clever Alice is an old <i>habitu&eacute;e</i>,
    and her timely arrival has saved many a situation which was
    twining itself about <a name="Page_36"
       id="Page_36"></a>more "ifs" than it could comfortably
       support. The wisdom which lies behind true humour is found
       in the nonsense tale of infancy as truly as in mature
       humour, but in its own kind and degree. "Just for fun" is
       the first reason for the humorous story; the wisdom in the
       fun is the second.</p>

    <p>And now we come to</p>

    <p><b>THE NATURE STORY</b></p>

    <p>No other type of fiction is more familiar to the teacher,
    and probably no other kind is the source of so much uncertainty
    of feeling. The nature story is much used, as I have noticed
    above, to illustrate or to teach the habits of animals and the
    laws of plant-growth; to stimulate scientific interest as well
    as to increase culture in scientific fact. This is an entirely
    legitimate object. In view of its present preponderance, it is
    certainly a pity, however, that so few stories are available,
    the accuracy of which, from this point of view, can be vouched
    for. The carefully prepared book of to-day is refuted and
    scoffed at to-morrow. The teacher who wishes to use
    story-telling chiefly as an element in nature study must at
    least limit herself to a small amount of absolutely
    unquestioned material, or else subject every new story to the
    judgment of an authority in the line dealt
    with.<a name="Page_37"
       id="Page_37"></a> This is not easy for the teacher at a
       distance from the great libraries, and for those who have
       access to well-equipped libraries it is a matter of time and
       thought.</p>

    <p>It does not so greatly trouble the teacher who uses the
    nature story as a story, rather than as a text-book, for she
    will not be so keenly attracted toward the books prepared with
    a didactic purpose. She will find a good gift for the child in
    nature stories which are stories, over and above any stimulus
    to his curiosity about fact. That good gift is a certain
    possession of all good fiction.</p>

    <p>One of the best things good fiction does for any of us is to
    broaden our comprehension of other lots than our own. The
    average man or woman has little opportunity actually to live
    more than one kind of life. The chances of birth, occupation,
    family ties, determine for most of us a line of experience not
    very inclusive and but little varied; and this is a natural
    barrier to our complete understanding of others, whose
    life-line is set at a different angle. It is not possible
    wholly to sympathise with emotions engendered by experience
    which one has never had. Yet we all long to be broad in
    sympathy and inclusive in appreciation; we long, greatly, to
    know the experience of others. This yearning is probably one of
    the good but misconceived appetites so injudiciously fed by the
    gossip of the daily press. There is a hope, in the reader,
    <a name="Page_38"
       id="Page_38"></a>of getting for the moment into the lives of
       people who move in wholly different sets of circumstances.
       But the relation of dry facts in newspapers, however tinged
       with journalistic colour, helps very little to enter such
       other life. The entrance has to be by the door of the
       imagination, and the journalist is rarely able to open it
       for us. But there is a genius who can open it. The author
       who can write fiction of the right sort can do it; his is
       the gift of seeing inner realities, and of showing them to
       those who cannot see them for themselves. Sharing the
       imaginative vision of the story-writer, we can truly follow
       out many other roads of life than our own. The girl on a
       lone country farm is made to understand how a girl in a city
       sweating-den feels and lives; the London exquisite realises
       the life of a Californian ranchman; royalty and tenement
       dwellers become acquainted, through the power of the
       imagination working on experience shown in the light of a
       human basis common to both. Fiction supplies an element of
       culture,&mdash;that of the sympathies, which is invaluable.
       And the beginnings of this culture, this widening and
       clearing of the avenues of human sympathy, are especially
       easily made with children in the nature story.</p>

    <p>When you begin, "There was once a little furry
    rabbit,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
       id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
       class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the child's curiosity is awakened
       <a name="Page_39"
       id="Page_39"></a>by the very fact that the rabbit is not a
       child, but something of a different species altogether. "Now
       for something new and adventuresome," says his expectation,
       "we are starting off into a foreign world." He listens
       wide-eyed, while you say, "and he lived in a warm, cosy
       nest, down under the long grass with his mother"&mdash;how
       delightful, to live in a place like that; so different from
       little boys' homes!&mdash;"his name was Raggylug, and his
       mother's name was Molly Cottontail. And every morning, when
       Molly Cottontail went out to get their food, she said to
       Raggylug, 'Now, Raggylug, remember you are only a baby
       rabbit, and don't move from the nest. No matter what you
       hear, no matter what you see, don't you move!'"&mdash;all
       this is different still, yet it is familiar, too; it appears
       that rabbits are rather like folks. So the tale proceeds,
       and the little furry rabbit passes through experiences
       strange to little boys, yet very like little boys'
       adventures in some respects; he is frightened by a snake,
       comforted by his mammy, and taken to a new house, under the
       long grass a long way off. These are all situations to which
       the child has a key. There is just enough of strangeness to
       entice, just enough of the familiar to relieve any strain.
       When the child has lived through the day's happenings with
       Raggylug, the latter has begun to seem veritably a little
       brother of the grass to him. And because he has entered
       <a name="Page_40"
       id="Page_40"></a>imaginatively into the feelings and fate of
       a creature different from himself, he has taken his first
       step out into the wide world of the lives of others.</p>

    <p>It may be a recognition of this factor and its value which
    has led so many writers of nature stories into the error of
    over-humanising their four-footed or feathered heroes and
    heroines. The exaggeration is unnecessary, for there is enough
    community of lot suggested in the sternest scientific record to
    constitute a natural basis for sympathy on the part of the
    human animal. Without any falsity of presentation whatever, the
    nature story may be counted on as a help in the beginnings of
    culture of the sympathies. It is not, of course, a help
    confined to the powers of the nature story; all types of story
    share in some degree the powers of each. But each has some
    especial virtue in dominant degree, and the nature story is, on
    this ground, identified with the thought given.</p>

    <p>The nature story shares its influence especially with</p>

    <p><b>THE HISTORICAL STORY</b></p>

    <p>As the one widens the circle of connection with other kinds
    of life, the other deepens the sense of relation to past lives;
    it gives the sense of background, of the close and endless
    connection of generation with generation. A good
    <a name="Page_41"
       id="Page_41"></a>historical story vitalises the conception
       of past events and brings their characters into relation
       with the present. This is especially true of stories of
       things and persons in the history of our own race. They
       foster race-consciousness, the feeling of kinship and
       community of blood. It is this property which makes the
       historical story so good an agent for furthering a proper
       national pride in children. Genuine patriotism, neither
       arrogant nor melodramatic, is so generally recognised as
       having its roots in early training that I need not dwell on
       this possibility, further than to note its connection with
       the instinct of hero-worship which is quick in the healthy
       child. Let us feed that hunger for the heroic which gnaws at
       the imagination of every boy and of more girls than is
       generally admitted. There have been heroes in plenty in the
       world's records,&mdash;heroes of action, of endurance, of
       decision, of faith. Biographical history is full of them.
       And the deeds of these heroes are every one a story. We tell
       these stories, both to bring the great past into its due
       relation with the living present, and to arouse that
       generous admiration and desire for emulation which is the
       source of so much inspiration in childhood. When these
       stories are tales of the doings and happenings of our own
       heroes, the strong men and women whose lives are a part of
       our own country's history, they serve the double
       <a name="Page_42"
       id="Page_42"></a>demands of hero-worship and patriotism.
       Stories of wise and honest statesmanship, of struggle with
       primitive conditions, of generous love and sacrifice,
       and&mdash;in some measure&mdash;of physical courage, form a
       subtle and powerful influence for pride in one's people, the
       intimate sense of kinship with one's own nation, and the
       desire to serve it in one's own time.</p>

    <p>It is not particularly useful to tell batches of unrelated
    anecdote. It is much more profitable to take up the story of a
    period and connect it with a group of interesting persons whose
    lives affected it or were affected by it, telling the stories
    of their lives, or of the events in which they were concerned,
    as "true stories." These biographical stories must, usually, be
    adapted for use. But besides these there is a certain number of
    pure stories&mdash;works of art&mdash;which already exist for
    us, and which illuminate facts and epochs almost without need
    of sidelights. Such may stand by themselves, or be used with
    only enough explanation to give background. Probably the best
    story of this kind known to lovers of modern literature is
    Daudet's famous <i>La Derni&egrave;re

    <p>The historical story, to recapitulate, gives a sense of the
    reality and humanness of past events, is a valuable aid in
    patriotic training, and stirs the desire of emulating goodness
    and wisdom.</p>

    <p>There is one picture which I can always review, in my own
    collection of past scenes, though many a more highly coloured
    one has been irrevocably curtained by the folds of
    forgetfulness. It is the picture of a little girl, standing by
    an old-fashioned marble-topped dressing-table in a pink, sunny
    room. I can never see the little girl's face, because, somehow,
    I am always looking down at her short skirts or twisting my
    head round against the hand which patiently combs her stubborn
    curls. But I can see the brushes and combs on the marble table
    quite plainly, and the pinker streaks of sun on the pink walls.
    And I can hear. I can hear a low, wonder-working voice which
    goes smoothly on and on, as the fingers run up the little
    girl's locks or stroke the hair into place on her forehead. The
    voice says, "And little Goldilocks came to a little bit of a
    house. And she opened the door and went in. It was the house
    where three Bears lived; there was a great Bear, a little Bear,
    and a middle-sized Bear; and they <a name="Page_44"
       id="Page_44"></a>had gone out for a walk. Goldilocks went
       in, and she saw"&mdash;the little girl is very still; she
       would not disturb that story by so much as a loud breath;
       but presently the comb comes to a tangle, pulls,&mdash;and
       the little girl begins to squirm. Instantly the voice
       becomes impressive, mysterious: "she went up to the table,
       and there were <i>three plates of porridge</i>. She tasted
       the first one"&mdash;the little girl swallows the breath she
       was going to whimper with, and waits&mdash;"and it was too
       hot! She tasted the next one, and <i>that</i> was too hot.
       Then she tasted the little bit of a plate, and
       that&mdash;was&mdash;just&mdash;right!"</p>

    <p>How I remember the delightful sense of achievement which
    stole into the little girl's veins when the voice behind her
    said "just right." I think she always chuckled a little, and
    hugged her stomach. So the story progressed, and the little
    girl got through her toilet without crying, owing to the
    wonder-working voice and its marvellous adaptation of climaxes
    to emergencies. Nine times out of ten, it was the story of
    <i>The Three Bears</i> she demanded when, with the appearance
    of brush and comb, the voice asked, "Which story shall mother
    tell?"</p>

    <p>It was a memory of the little girl in the pink room which
    made it easy for me to understand some other children's
    preferences when I recently had occasion to inquire about them.
    By asking many individual children which story
    <a name="Page_45"
       id="Page_45"></a>of all they had heard they liked best, by
       taking votes on the best story of a series, after telling
       it, and by getting some obliging teachers to put similar
       questions to their pupils, I found three prime favourites
       common to a great many children of about the kindergarten
       age. They were <i>The Three Bears</i>, <i>Three Little
       Pigs</i>, and <i>The Little Pig that wouldn't go over the
       Stile</i>.</p>

    <p>Some of the teachers were genuinely disturbed because the
    few stories they had introduced merely for amusement had taken
    so pre-eminent a place in the children's affection over those
    which had been given seriously. It was of no use, however, to
    suggest substitutes. The children knew definitely what they
    liked, and though they accepted the recapitulation of
    scientific and moral stories with polite approbation, they
    returned to the original answer at a repetition of the
    question.</p>

    <p>Inasmuch as the slightest of the things we hope to do for
    children by means of stories is quite impossible unless the
    children enjoy the stories, it may be worth our while to
    consider seriously these three which they surely do enjoy, to
    see what common qualities are in them, explanatory of their
    popularity, by which we may test the probable success of other
    stories we wish to tell.</p>

    <p>Here they are,&mdash;three prime favourites of proved
    standing.</p>

    <p>Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who went from
    home to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man
    with a bundle of straw, and said to him:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Good man, give me that straw to build me a house."</p>

    <p>The man gave the straw, and the little pig built his house
    with it. Presently came along a wolf, and knocked at the door,
    and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."</p>

    <p>But the pig answered:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"No, no, by the hair of my chiny-chin-chin."</p>

    <p>So the wolf said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house
    in."</p>

    <p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and
    ate up the little pig.</p>

    <p>The second little pig met a man with a bundle of furze, and
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Good man, give me that furze to build me a house."</p>

    <p>The man gave the furze, and the pig built his house. Then
    once more came the wolf, and said:</p>

    <p>"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."</p>

    <p>"No, no, by the hair of my chiny-chin-chin."</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_47"
       id="Page_47"></a>Then I'll puff, and I'll huff, and I'll
       blow your house in."</p>

    <p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed,
    and at last he blew the house in, and ate up the little
    pig.</p>

    <p>The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, and
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Good man, give me those bricks to build me a house
    with."</p>

    <p>The man gave the bricks, and he built his house with them.
    Again the wolf came, and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Little pig, little pig, let me come in."</p>

    <p>"No, no, by the hair of my chiny-chin-chin."</p>

    <p>"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house
    in."</p>

    <p>So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed,
    and he puffed and huffed; but he could not get the house down.
    Finding that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing,
    blow the house down, he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Little pig, I know where there is a nice field of
    turnips."</p>

    <p>"Where?" said the little pig.</p>

    <p>"Oh, in Mr Smith's field, and if you will be ready to-morrow
    morning we will go together, and get some for dinner."</p>

    <p>"Very well," said the little pig. "What time do you mean to
    go I"</p>

    <p>"Oh, at six o'clock."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_48"
       id="Page_48"></a>So the little pig got up at five, and got
       the turnips before the wolf came crying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Little pig, are you ready?"</p>

    <p>The little pig said: "Ready! I have been and come back
    again, and got a nice potful for dinner."</p>

    <p>The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would
    be a match for the little pig somehow or other, so he
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Little pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree."</p>

    <p>"Where?" said the pig.</p>

    <p>"Down at Merry-garden," replied the wolf, "and if you will
    not deceive me I will come for you, at five o'clock to-morrow,
    and get some apples."</p>

    <p>The little pig got up next morning at four o'clock, and went
    off for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came;
    but it took long to climb the tree, and just as he was coming
    down from it, he saw the wolf coming. When the wolf came up he
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Little pig, what! are you here before me? Are they nice
    apples?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, very," said the little pig. "I will throw you down
    one."</p>

    <p>And he threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone to pick
    it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day
    the wolf came again, and said to the little pig:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Little pig, there is a fair in town this afternoon; will
    you go?"</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_49"
       id="Page_49"></a>Oh yes," said the pig, "I will go; what
       time?"</p>

    <p>"At three," said the wolf. As usual the little pig went off
    before the time, and got to the fair, and bought a
    butter-churn, which he was rolling home when he saw the wolf
    coming. So he got into the churn to hide, and in so doing
    turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in
    it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without
    going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told
    him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which
    came past him down the hill. Then the little pig
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Ha! ha! I frightened you, then!"</p>

    <p>Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and tried to get down
    the chimney in order to eat up the little pig. When the little
    pig saw what he was about, he put a pot full of water on the
    blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, he took
    off the cover, and in fell the wolf. Quickly the little pig
    clapped on the cover, and when the wolf was boiled ate him for
    supper.</p>

    <p>Once upon a time there were Three Bears, who lived together
    in a house of their own, in a wood. One of them was a Little
    Small Wee<a name="Page_50"
       id="Page_50"></a> Bear, and one was a Middle-sized Bear, and
       the other was a Great Huge Bear. They had each a pot for
       their porridge,&mdash;a little pot for the Little Small Wee
       Bear, and a middle-sized pot for the Middle-sized Bear, and
       a great pot for the Great Huge Bear. And they had each a
       chair to sit in,&mdash;a little chair for the Little Small
       Wee Bear, and a middle-sized chair for the Middle-sized
       Bear, and a great chair for the Great Huge Bear. And they
       had each a bed to sleep in,&mdash;a little bed for the
       Little Small Wee Bear, and a middle-sized bed for the
       Middle-sized Bear, and a great bed for the Great Huge
       Bear.</p>

    <p>One day, after they had made the porridge for their
    breakfast, and poured it into their porridge-pots, they walked
    out into the wood while the porridge was cooling, that they
    might not burn their mouths, by beginning too soon to eat it.
    And while they were walking, a little girl named Goldilocks
    came to the house. She had never seen the little house before,
    and it was such a strange little house that she forgot all the
    things her mother had told her about being polite: first she
    looked in at the window, and then she peeped in at the keyhole;
    and seeing nobody in the house, she lifted the latch. The door
    was not fastened, because the Bears were good Bears, who did
    nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm
    <a name="Page_51"
       id="Page_51"></a>them. So Goldilocks opened the door, and
       went in; and well pleased she was when she saw the porridge
       on the table. If Goldilocks had remembered what her mother
       had told her, she would have waited till the Bears came
       home, and then, perhaps, they would have asked her to
       breakfast; for they were good Bears&mdash;a little rough, as
       the manner of Bears is, but for all that very good-natured
       and hospitable. But Goldilocks forgot, and set about helping
       herself.</p>

    <p>So first she tasted the porridge of the Great Huge Bear, and
    that was too hot. And then she tasted the porridge of the
    Middle-sized Bear, and that was too cold. And then she went to
    the porridge of the Little Small Wee Bear, and tasted that: and
    that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right; and she
    liked it so well, that she ate it all up.</p>

    <p>Then Goldilocks sat down in the chair of the Great Huge
    Bear, and that was too hard for her. And then she sat down in
    the chair of the Middle-sized Bear, and that was too soft for
    her. And then she sat down in the chair of the Little Small Wee
    Bear, and that was neither too hard nor too soft, but just
    right. So she seated herself in it, and there she sat till the
    bottom of the chair came out, and down she came, plump upon the
    ground.</p>

    <p>Then Goldilocks went upstairs into the bed-chamber in which
    the Three Bears slept. And <a name="Page_52"
       id="Page_52"></a>first she lay down upon the bed of the
       Great Huge Bear; but that was too high at the head for her.
       And next she lay down upon the bed of the Middle-sized Bear,
       and that was too high at the foot for her. And then she lay
       down upon the bed of the Little Small Wee Bear; and that was
       neither too high at the head nor at the foot, but just
       right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there
       till she fell fast asleep.</p>

    <p>By this time the Three Bears thought their porridge would be
    cool enough; so they came home to breakfast. Now Goldilocks had
    left the spoon of the Great Huge Bear standing in his
    porridge.</p>

    <p><big>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!"</big> said the
    Great Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice. And when the
    Middle-sized Bear looked at his, he saw that the spoon was
    standing in it too.</p>

    <p>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!" said the Middle-sized
    Bear, in his middle-sized voice.</p>

    <p>Then the Little Small Wee Bear looked at his, and there was
    the spoon in the porridge-pot, but the porridge was all
    gone.</p>

    <p><small>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE, AND HAS EATEN IT
    ALL UP!"</small> said the Little Small Wee Bear, in his little,
    small, wee voice.</p>

    <p>Upon this, the Three Bears, seeing that someone had entered
    their house, and eaten up the<a name="Page_53"
       id="Page_53"></a> Little Small Wee Bear's breakfast, began
       to look about them. Now Goldilocks had not put the hard
       cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the Great
       Huge Bear.</p>

    <p><big>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!"</big> said the
    Great Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.</p>

    <p>And Goldilocks had crushed down the soft cushion of the
    Middle-sized Bear.</p>

    <p>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR!" said the
    Middle-sized Bear, in his middle-sized voice.</p>

    <p>And you know what Goldilocks had done to the third
    chair.</p>

    <p><small>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY CHAIR AND HAS SAT
    THE BOTTOM OUT OF IT!"</small> said the Little Small Wee Bear,
    in his little, small, wee voice.</p>

    <p>Then the Three Bears thought it necessary that they should
    make further search; so they went upstairs into their
    bed-chamber. Now Goldilocks had pulled the pillow of the Great
    Huge Bear out of its place.</p>

    <p><big>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!"</big> said the
    Great Huge Bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.</p>

    <p>And Goldilocks had pulled the bolster of the Middle-sized
    Bear out of its place.</p>

    <p>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!" said the Middle-sized
    Bear, in his middle-sized voice.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_54"
       id="Page_54"></a>And when the Little Small Wee Bear came to
       look at his bed, there was the bolster in its place; and the
       pillow in its place upon the bolster; and upon the pillow
       was the shining, yellow hair of little Goldilocks!</p>

    <p><small>"SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED,&mdash;AND HERE
    SHE IS!"</small> said the Little Small Wee Bear, in his little,
    small, wee voice.</p>

    <p>Goldilocks had heard in her sleep the great, rough, gruff
    voice of the Great Huge Bear; but she was so fast asleep that
    it was no more to her than the roaring of wind or the rumbling
    of thunder. And she had heard the middle-sized voice of the
    Middle-sized Bear, but it was only as if she had heard someone
    speaking in a dream. But when she heard the little, small, wee
    voice of the Little Small Wee Bear, it was so sharp, and so
    shrill, that it awakened her at once. Up she started, and when
    she saw the Three Bears on one side of the bed, she tumbled
    herself out at the other, and ran to the window. Now the window
    was open, because the Bears, like good, tidy Bears as they
    were, always opened their bed-chamber window when they got up
    in the morning.</p>

    <p>Out little Goldilocks jumped, and ran away home to her
    mother, as fast as ever she could.</p>

    <p>It happened one day that as an old woman was sweeping her
    house she found a little crooked sixpence. "What," said she,
    "shall I do with this little sixpence? I will go to market, and
    buy a little pig."</p>

    <p>On the way home she came to a stile; but the piggy wouldn't
    go over the stile.</p>

    <p>So she left the piggy and went on a little further, till she
    met a dog. She said to him, "Dog, dog, bite pig; piggy won't go
    over the stile; and I sha'n't get home to-night." But the dog
    wouldn't bite piggy.</p>

    <p>A little further on she met a stick. So she said: "Stick!
    stick! beat dog! dog won't bite pig; piggy won't go over the
    stile; and I sha'n't get home to-night." But the stick wouldn't
    beat the dog.</p>

    <p>A little further on she met a fire. So she said: "Fire!
    fire! burn stick! stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig;
    piggy won't get over the stile; and I sha'n't get home
    to-night." But the fire wouldn't burn the stick.</p>

    <p>A little further on she met some water. So she said: "Water!
    water! quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't beat
    dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile;
    <a name="Page_56"
       id="Page_56"></a>and I sha'n't get home to-night." But the
       water wouldn't quench the fire.</p>

    <p>A little further on she met an ox. So she said: "Ox! ox!
    drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick;
    stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over
    the stile; and I sha'n't get home to-night." But the ox
    wouldn't drink the water.</p>

    <p>A little further on she met a butcher. So she said:
    "Butcher! butcher! kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't
    quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog
    won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile; and I sha'n't
    get home to-night." But the butcher wouldn't kill the ox.</p>

    <p>A little further on she met a rope. So she said: "Rope!
    rope! hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox won't drink
    water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick
    won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the
    stile; and I sha'n't get home to-night." But the rope wouldn't
    hang the butcher.</p>

    <p>A little further on she met a rat. So she said: "Rat! rat!
    gnaw rope; rope won't hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox
    won't drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn
    stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't
    get over the stile; and I sha'n't get home to-night." But the
    rat wouldn't gnaw the rope.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_57"
       id="Page_57"></a>A little further on she met a cat. So she
       said: "Cat! cat! kill rat; rat won't gnaw rope; rope won't
       hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox won't drink water;
       water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't
       beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the
       stile; and I sha'n't get home to-night." But the cat said to
       her, "If you will go to yonder cow, and fetch me a saucer of
       milk, I will kill the rat." So away went the old woman to
       the cow.</p>

    <p>But the cow refused to give the milk unless the old woman
    first gave her a handful of hay. So away went the old woman to
    the haystack; and she brought the hay to the cow.</p>

    <p>When the cow had eaten the hay, she gave the old woman the
    milk; and away she went with it in a saucer to the cat.</p>

    <p>As soon as it had lapped up the milk, the cat began to kill
    the rat; the rat began to gnaw the rope; the rope began to hang
    the butcher; the butcher began to kill the ox; the ox began to
    drink the water; the water began to quench the fire; the fire
    began to burn the stick; the stick began to beat the dog; the
    dog began to bite the pig; the little pig in a fright jumped
    over the stile; and so the old woman did get home that
    night.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />

    <p>The briefest examination of these three stories reveals the
    fact that one attribute is <a name="Page_58"
       id="Page_58"></a>beyond dispute in each. Something happens,
       all the time. Every step in each story is an event. There is
       no time spent in explanation, description, or telling how
       people felt; the stories tell what people did, and what they
       said. And the events are the links of a sequence of the
       closest kind; in point of time and of cause they follow as
       immediately as it is possible for events to follow. There
       are no gaps, and no complications of plot requiring a return
       on the road.</p>

    <p>A second common characteristic appears on briefest
    examination. As you run over the little stories you will see
    that each event presents a distinct picture to the imagination,
    and that these pictures are made out of very simple elements.
    The elements are either familiar to the child or analogous to
    familiar ones. Each object and happening is very like everyday,
    yet touched with a subtle difference, rich in mystery. For
    example, the details of the pictures in the Goldilocks story
    are parts of everyday life,&mdash;house, chairs, beds, and so
    on; but they are the house, chairs, and beds of three bears;
    that is the touch of marvel which transforms the scene. The old
    woman who owned the obstinate pig is the centre of a circle in
    which stand only familiar images,&mdash;stick, fire, water,
    cow, and the rest; but the wonder enters with the fact that
    these usually inanimate or dumb objects of nature enter so
    humanly into <a name="Page_59"
       id="Page_59"></a>the contest of wills. So it is, also, with
       the doings of the three little pigs. Every image is
       explicable to the youngest hearer, while none suggests
       actual familiarity, because the actors are not children, but
       pigs. Simplicity, with mystery, is the keynote of all the
       pictures, and these are clear and distinct.</p>

    <p>Still a third characteristic common to the stories quoted is
    a certain amount of repetition. It is more definite, and of
    what has been called the "cumulative" kind, in the story of the
    old woman; but in all it is a distinctive feature.</p>

    <p>Here we have, then, three marked characteristics common to
    three stories almost invariably loved by
    children,&mdash;action, in close sequence; familiar images,
    tinged with mystery; some degree of repetition.</p>

    <p>It is not hard to see why these qualities appeal to a child.
    The first is the prime characteristic of all good
    stories,&mdash;"stories as is stories"; the child's demand for
    it but bears witness to the fact that his instinctive taste is
    often better than the taste he later develops under artificial
    culture. The second is a matter of common-sense. How could the
    imagination create new worlds, save out of the material of the
    old? To offer strange images is to confuse the mind and dull
    the interest; to offer familiar ones "with a difference" is to
    pique the interest and engage the mind.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_60"
       id="Page_60"></a>The charm of repetition, to children, is a
       more complex matter; there are undoubtedly a good many
       elements entering into it, hard to trace in analysis. But
       one or two of the more obvious may be seized and brought to
       view. The first is the subtle flattery of an unexpected
       sense of mastery. When the child-mind, following with
       toilful alertness a new train of thought, comes suddenly on
       a familiar epithet or expression, I fancy it is with much
       the same sense of satisfaction that we older people feel
       when in the midst of a long programme of new music the
       orchestra strikes into something we have heard
       before,&mdash;Handel, maybe, or one of the more familiar
       Beethoven sonatas. "I know that! I have heard that before!"
       we think, triumphant, and settle down to enjoyment without
       effort. So it is, probably, with the "middle-sized" articles
       of the bears' house and the "and I sha'n't get home
       to-night" of the old woman. Each recurrence deepens the note
       of familiarity, tickles the primitive sense of humour, and
       eases the strain of attention.</p>

    <p>When the repetition is cumulative, like the extreme instance
    of <i>The House that Jack Built</i>, I have a notion that the
    joy of the child is the pleasure of intellectual gymnastics,
    not too hard for fun, but not too easy for excitement. There is
    a deal of fun to be got out of purely intellectual processes,
    and child<a name="Page_61"
       id="Page_61"></a>hood is not too soon for the rudiments of
       such fun to show. The delight the healthy adult mind takes
       in working out a neat problem in geometry, the pleasure a
       musician finds in following the involutions of a fugue, are
       of the same type of satisfaction as the liking of children
       for cumulative stories. Complexity and mass, arrived at by
       stages perfectly intelligible in themselves, mounting
       steadily from a starting-point of simplicity; then the same
       complexity and mass resolving itself as it were miraculously
       back into simplicity, this is an intellectual joy. It does
       not differ materially, whether found in the study of
       counterpoint, at thirty, or in the story of the old woman
       and her pig, at five. It is perfectly natural and wholesome,
       and it may perhaps be a more powerful developing force for
       the budding intellect than we are aware.</p>

    <p>For these reasons let me urge you, when you are looking for
    stories to tell little children, to apply this threefold test
    as a kind of touchstone to their quality of fitness: Are they
    full of action, in close natural sequence? Are their images
    simple without being humdrum? Are they repetitive? The last
    quality is not an absolute requisite; but it is at least very
    often an attribute of a good child-story.</p>

    <p>Having this touchstone in mind for general selection, we can
    now pass to the matter of <a name="Page_62"
       id="Page_62"></a>specific choices for different ages of
       children. No one can speak with absolute conviction in this
       matter, so greatly do the taste and capacity of children of
       the same age vary. Any approach to an exact classification
       of juvenile books according to their suitability for
       different ages will be found impossible. The same book in
       the hands of a skilful narrator may be made to afford
       delight to children both of five and ten. The following are
       merely the inferences drawn from my own experience. They
       must be modified by each teacher according to the conditions
       of her small audience. In general, I believe it to be wise
       to plan the choice of stories much as indicated in the table
       given on page 64.</p>

    <p>At a later stage, varying with the standard of capacity of
    different classes, we find the temper of mind which asks
    continually, "Is that true?" To meet this demand, one draws on
    historical and scientific anecdote, and on reminiscence. But
    the demand is never so exclusive that fictitious narrative need
    be cast aside. All that is necessary is to state frankly that
    the story you are telling is "just a story," or&mdash;if it be
    the case&mdash;that it is "part true and part story."</p>

    <p>At all stages I would urge the telling of Bible stories, as
    far as is allowed by the special circumstances of the school.
    These are stories <a name="Page_63"
       id="Page_63"></a>from a source unsurpassed in our literature
       for purity of style and loftiness of subject. More
       especially I urge the telling of the Christ-story, in such
       parts as seem likely to be within the grasp of the several
       classes. In all Bible stories it is well to keep as near as
       possible to the original unimprovable
       text.<a name="FNanchor_1_6"
       id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6"
       class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Some amplification can be made, but
       no excessive modernising or simplifying is excusable in face
       of the austere grace and majestic simplicity of the
       original. Such adaptation as helps to cut the long narrative
       into separate units, making each an intelligible story, I
       have ventured to illustrate according to my own personal
       taste, in two stories given in Chapter VI. The object of the
       usual modernising or enlarging of the text may be far better
       attained for the child listener by infusing into the text as
       it stands a strong realising sense of its meaning and
       vitality, letting it give its own message through a fit
       medium of expression.</p>

    <p>It soon becomes easy to pick out from a collection such
    stories as can be well told; but at no time is it easy to find
    a sufficient number of such stories. Stories simple, direct,
    and sufficiently full of incident for telling, yet having the
    beautiful or valuable motive we desire for children, do not lie
    hidden in every book. And even many of the stories which are
    most charming to read do not answer the double demand, for the
    appeal to the eye differs in many important respects from that
    to the ear. Unless one is able to change the form of a story to
    suit the needs of oral delivery, one is likely to suffer from
    poverty of material. Perhaps the commonest need of change is in
    the case of a story too long to tell, yet embodying some one
    beautiful incident or lesson; or one including a series of such
    incidents. The story of <i>The N&uuml;rnberg Stove</i>, by
    Ouida,<a name="FNanchor_1_8"
       id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8"
       class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is a good example of the latter
       kind; Ruskin's <i>King of the Golden River</i> will serve as
       an illustration of the former.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <p><a name="Footnote_1_8"
           id="Footnote_1_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_8"><span class="label">
        [1]</span></a> See <i>Bimbi</i>, by Ouida. (Chatto.
        2s.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>The problem in one case is chiefly one of <a name="Page_68"
       id="Page_68"></a>elimination; in the other it is also in a
       large degree one of rearrangement. In both cases I have
       purposely chosen extreme instances, as furnishing plainer
       illustration. The usual story needs less adaptation than
       these, but the same kind, in its own degree. Condensation
       and rearrangement are the commonest forms of change
       required.</p>

    <p>Pure condensation is probably the easier for most persons.
    With <a name="The_Nuumlrnberg_Stove"
       id="The_Nuumlrnberg_Stove"></a><i>The N&uuml;rnberg
       Stove</i> in mind for reference, let us see what the process
       includes. This story can be readily found by anyone who is
       interested in the following example of adaptation, for
       nearly every library includes in its catalogue the juvenile
       works of Mlle. de la Ram&eacute;e (Ouida). The suggestions
       given assume that the story is before my readers.</p>

    <p>The story as it stands is two thousand four hundred words
    long, obviously too long to tell. What can be left out? Let us
    see what must be kept in.</p>

    <p>The dramatic climax toward which we are working is the
    outcome of August's strange exploit,&mdash;his discovery by the
    king and the opportunity for him to become an artist. The joy
    of this climax is twofold: August may stay with his beloved
    Hirschvogel, and he may learn to make beautiful things like it.
    To arrive at the twofold conclusion we must start from a
    <a name="Page_69"
       id="Page_69"></a>double premise,&mdash;the love of the stove
       and the yearning to be an artist. It will, then, be
       necessary to include in the beginning of the story enough
       details of the family life to show plainly how precious and
       necessary Hirschvogel was to the children; and to state
       definitely how August had learned to admire and wish to
       emulate Hirschvogel's maker. We need no detail beyond what
       is necessary to make this clear.</p>

    <p>The beginning and the end of a story decided upon, its body
    becomes the bridge from one to the other; in this case it is
    August's strange journey, beginning with the catastrophe and
    his grief-dazed decision to follow the stove. The journey is
    long, and each stage of it is told in full. As this is
    impossible in oral reproduction, it becomes necessary to choose
    typical incidents, which will give the same general effect as
    the whole. The incidents which answer this purpose are: the
    beginning of the journey, the experience on the luggage train,
    the jolting while being carried on men's shoulders, the final
    fright and suspense before the king opens the door.</p>

    <p>The episode of the night in the bric-a-brac shop introduces
    a wholly new and confusing train of thought; therefore,
    charming as it is, it must be omitted. And the secondary thread
    of narrative interest, that of the prices for which
    <a name="Page_70"
       id="Page_70"></a>the stove was sold, and the retribution
       visited on the cheating dealers, is also "another story,"
       and must be ignored. Each of these destroys the clear
       sequence and the simplicity of plot which must be kept for
       telling.</p>

    <p>We are reduced, then, for the whole, to this: a brief
    preliminary statement of the place Hirschvogel held in the
    household affections, and the ambition aroused in August; the
    catastrophe of the sale; August's decision; his experiences on
    the train, on the shoulders of men, and just before the
    discovery; his discovery, and the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>.</p>

    <p>This not only reduces the story to tellable form, but it
    also leaves a suggestive interest which heightens later
    enjoyment of the original. I suggest the adaptation of Kate
    Douglas Wiggin, in <i>The Story Hour</i>, since in view of the
    existence of a satisfactory adaptation it seems unappreciative
    to offer a second. The one I made for my own use some years ago
    is not dissimilar to this, and I have no reason to suppose it
    more desirable.</p>

    <p>Ruskin's <i>King of the Golden River</i> is somewhat
    difficult to adapt. Not only is it long, but its style is
    mature, highly descriptive, and closely allegorical. Yet the
    tale is too beautiful and too suggestive to be lost to the
    story-teller. And it is, also, so recognised a part of the
    standard literary equipment of youth that <a name="Page_71"
       id="Page_71"></a>teachers need to be able to introduce
       children to its charm. To make it available for telling, we
       must choose the most essential events of the series leading
       up to the climax, and present these so simply as to appeal
       to children's ears, and so briefly as not to tire them.</p>

    <p>The printed story is eight thousand words in length. The
    first three thousand words depict the beauty and fertility of
    the Treasure Valley, and the cruel habits of Hans and Schwartz,
    its owners, and give the culminating incident which leads to
    their banishment by "West Wind." This episode,&mdash;the West
    Wind's appearance in the shape of an aged traveller, his kind
    reception by the younger brother, little Gluck, and the
    subsequent wrath of Hans and Schwartz, with their resulting
    punishment,&mdash;occupies about two thousand words. The rest
    of the story deals with the three brothers after the decree of
    West Wind has turned Treasure Valley into a desert. In the
    little house where they are plying their trade of goldsmiths,
    the King of the Golden River appears to Gluck and tells him the
    magic secret of turning the river's waters to gold. Hans and
    Schwartz in turn attempt the miracle, and in turn incur the
    penalty attached to failure. Gluck tries, and wins the treasure
    through self-sacrifice. The form of the treasure is a renewal
    of the fertility of Treasure Valley, and the moral of the whole
    story is summed up in<a name="Page_72"
       id="Page_72"></a> Ruskin's words, "So the inheritance which
       was lost by cruelty was regained by love."</p>

    <p>It is easy to see that the dramatic part of the story and
    that which most pointedly illustrates the underlying idea, is
    the triple attempt to win the treasure,&mdash;the two failures
    and the one success. But this is necessarily introduced by the
    episode of the King of the Golden River, which is, also, an
    incident sure to appeal to a child's imagination. And the
    regaining of the inheritance is meaningless without the fact of
    its previous loss, and the reason for the loss, as a contrast
    with the reason for its recovery. We need, then, the main facts
    recorded in the first three thousand words. But the West Wind
    episode must be avoided, not only for brevity, but because two
    supernatural appearances, so similar, yet of different
    personalities, would hopelessly confuse a told story.</p>

    <p>Our oral story is now to be made out of a condensed
    statement of the character of the Valley and of its owners, and
    the manner of its loss; the intervention of the King of the
    Golden River; the three attempts to turn the river to gold, and
    Gluck's success. Gluck is to be our hero, and our underlying
    idea is the power of love <i>versus</i> cruelty. Description is
    to be reduced to its lowest terms, and the language made simple
    and concrete.</p>

    <p>With this outline in mind, it may be useful
    <a name="Page_73"
       id="Page_73"></a>to compare the following adaptation with
       the original story. The adaptation is not intended in any
       sense as a substitute for the original, but merely as that
       form of it which can be <i>told</i>, while the original
       remains for reading.</p>

    <p>There was once a beautiful little valley, where the sun was
    warm, and the rains fell softly; its apples were so red, its
    corn so yellow, its grapes so blue, that it was called the
    Treasure Valley. Not a river ran into it, but one great river
    flowed down the mountains on the other side, and because the
    setting sun always tinged its high cataract with gold after
    the rest of the world was dark, it was called the Golden River.
    The lovely valley belonged to three brothers. The youngest,
    little Gluck, was happy-hearted and kind, but he had a hard
    life with his brothers, for Hans and Schwartz were so cruel and
    so mean that they were known everywhere around as the "Black
    Brothers." They were hard to their farm hands, hard to their
    customers, hard to the poor, and hardest of all to Gluck.</p>

    <p>At last the Black Brothers became so bad that the Spirit of
    the West Wind took vengeance on them; he forbade any of the
    gentle <a name="Page_74"
       id="Page_74"></a>winds, south and west, to bring rain to the
       valley. Then, since there were no rivers in it, it dried up,
       and instead of a treasure valley it became a desert of dry,
       red sand. The Black Brothers could get nothing out of it,
       and they wandered out into the world on the other side of
       the mountain-peaks; and little Gluck went with them.</p>

    <p>Hans and Schwartz went out every day, wasting their time in
    wickedness, but they left Gluck in the house to work. And they
    lived on the gold and silver they had saved in Treasure Valley,
    till at last it was all gone. The only precious thing left was
    Gluck's gold mug. This the Black Brothers decided to melt into
    spoons, to sell; and in spite of Gluck's tears, they put it in
    the melting pot, and went out, leaving him to watch it.</p>

    <p>Poor little Gluck sat at the window, trying not to cry for
    his dear golden mug, and as the sun began to go down, he saw
    the beautiful cataract of the Golden River turn red, and
    yellow, and then pure gold.</p>

    <p>"Oh, dear!" he said to himself, "how fine it would be if the
    river were really golden! I needn't be poor, then."</p>

    <p>"It wouldn't be fine at all!" said a thin, metallic little
    voice, in his ear.</p>

    <p>"Mercy, what's that!" said Gluck, looking all about. But
    nobody was there.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_75"
       id="Page_75"></a>Suddenly the sharp little voice came
       again.</p>

    <p>"Pour me out," it said, "I am too hot!"</p>

    <p>It seemed to come right from the oven, and as Gluck stood,
    staring in fright, it came again, "Pour me out; I'm too
    hot!"</p>

    <p>Gluck was very much frightened, but he went and looked in
    the melting pot. When he touched it, the little voice said,
    "Pour me out, I say!" And Gluck took the handle and began to
    pour the gold out.</p>

    <p>First came out a tiny pair of yellow legs; then a pair of
    yellow coat-tails; then a strange little yellow body, and,
    last, a wee yellow face, with long curls of gold hair. And the
    whole put itself together as it fell, and stood up on the
    floor,&mdash;the strangest little yellow dwarf, about a foot
    high!</p>

    <p>"Dear, me!" said Gluck.</p>

    <p>But the little yellow man said, "Gluck, do you know who I
    am? I am the King of the Golden River."</p>

    <p>Gluck did not know what to say, so he said nothing; and,
    indeed, the little man gave him no chance. He said, "Gluck, I
    have been watching you, and what I have seen of you, I like.
    Listen, and I will tell you something for your good. Whoever
    shall climb to the top of the mountain from which the Golden
    River falls, and shall cast into its waters three drops of holy
    water, for him and him only shall its waters turn to gold. But
    no one can suc<a name="Page_76"
       id="Page_76"></a>ceed except at the first trial, and anyone
       who casts unholy water in the river will be turned into a
       black stone."</p>

    <p>And then, before Gluck could draw his breath, the King
    walked straight into the hottest flame of the fire, and
    vanished up the chimney!</p>

    <p>"When Gluck's brothers came home, they beat him black and
    blue, because the mug was gone. But when he told them about the
    King of the Golden River they quarrelled all night, as to which
    should go to get the gold. At last, Hans, who was the stronger,
    got the better of Schwartz, and started off. The priest would
    not give such a bad man any holy water, so he stole a
    bottleful. Then he took a basket of bread and wine, and began
    to climb the mountain.</p>

    <p>He climbed fast, and soon came to the end of the first hill.
    But there he found a great glacier, a hill of ice, which he had
    never seen before. It was horrible to cross,&mdash;the ice was
    slippery, great gulfs yawned before him, and noises like groans
    and shrieks came from under his feet. He lost his basket of
    bread and wine, and was quite faint with fear and exhaustion
    when his feet touched firm ground again.</p>

    <p>Next he came to a hill of hot, red rock, without a bit of
    grass to ease the feet, or a particle of shade. After an hour's
    climb he was so thirsty that he felt that he must drink. He
    looked at the flask of water. "Three drops <a name="Page_77"
       id="Page_77"></a>are enough," he thought; "I will just cool
       my lips." He was lifting the flask to his lips when he saw
       something beside him in the path. It was a small dog, and it
       seemed to be dying of thirst. Its tongue was out, its legs
       were lifeless, and a swarm of black ants were crawling about
       its lips. It looked piteously at the bottle which Hans held.
       Hans raised the bottle, drank, kicked at the animal, and
       passed on.</p>

    <p>A strange black shadow came across the blue sky.</p>

    <p>Another hour Hans climbed; the rocks grew hotter and the way
    steeper every moment. At last he could bear it no longer; he
    must drink. The bottle was half empty, but he decided to drink
    half of what was left. As he lifted it, something moved in the
    path beside him. It was a child, lying nearly dead of thirst on
    the rock, its eyes closed, its lips burning, its breath coming
    in gasps. Hans looked at it, drank, and passed on.</p>

    <p>A dark cloud came over the sun, and long shadows crept up
    the mountain-side.</p>

    <p>It grew very steep now, and the air weighed like lead on
    Hans's forehead, but the Golden River was very near. Hans
    stopped a moment to breathe, then started to climb the last
    height.</p>

    <p>As he clambered on, he saw an old, old man lying in the
    path. His eyes were sunken, and his face deadly pale.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_78"
       id="Page_78"></a>Water!" he said; "water!"</p>

    <p>"I have none for you," said Hans; "you have had your share
    of life." He strode over the old man's body and climbed on.</p>

    <p>A flash of blue lightning dazzled him for an instant, and
    then the heavens were dark.</p>

    <p>At last Hans stood on the brink of the cataract of the
    Golden River. The sound of its roaring filled the air. He drew
    the flask from his side and hurled it into the torrent. As he
    did so, an icy chill shot through him; he shrieked and fell.
    And the river rose and flowed over</p>

    <p><b>The Black Stone.</b></p>

    <p>When Hans did not come back Gluck grieved, but Schwartz was
    glad. He decided to go and get the gold for himself. He thought
    it might not do to steal the holy water, as Hans had done, so
    he took the money little Gluck had earned, and bought holy
    water of a bad priest. Then he took a basket of bread and wine,
    and started off.</p>

    <p>He came to the great hill of ice, and was as surprised as
    Hans had been, and found it as hard to cross. Many times he
    slipped, and he was much frightened at the noises, and was very
    glad to get across, although he had lost his basket of bread
    and wine. Then he came to the same hill of sharp, red stone,
    without grass or shade, that Hans had climbed. And like Hans he
    became very thirsty. Like Hans, too, he decided to
    <a name="Page_79"
       id="Page_79"></a>drink a little of the water. As he raised
       it to his lips, he suddenly saw the same fair child that
       Hans had seen.</p>

    <p>"Water!" said the child. "Water! I am dying."</p>

    <p>"I have not enough for myself," said Schwartz, and passed
    on.</p>

    <p>A low bank of black cloud rose out of the west.</p>

    <p>When he had climbed for another hour, the thirst overcame
    him again, and again he lifted the flask to his lips. As he did
    so, he saw an old man who begged for water.</p>

    <p>"I have not enough for myself," said Schwartz, and passed
    on.</p>

    <p>A mist, of the colour of blood, came over the sun.</p>

    <p>Then Schwartz climbed for another hour, and once more he had
    to drink. This time, as he lifted the flask, he thought he saw
    his brother Hans before him. The figure stretched its arms to
    him, and cried out for water.</p>

    <p>"Ha, ha," laughed Schwartz, "do you suppose I brought the
    water up here for you?" And he strode over the figure. But when
    he had gone a few yards farther, he looked back, and the figure
    was not there.</p>

    <p>Then he stood at the brink of the Golden River, and its
    waves were black, and the roaring of the waters filled all the
    air. He cast the <a name="Page_80"
       id="Page_80"></a>flask into the stream. And as he did so the
       lightning glared in his eyes, the earth gave way beneath
       him, and the river flowed over</p>

    <p><b>The Two Black Stones.</b></p>

    <p>When Gluck found himself alone, he at last decided to try
    his luck with the King of the Golden River. The priest gave him
    some holy water as soon as he asked for it, and with this and a
    basket of bread he started off.</p>

    <p>The hill of ice was much harder for Gluck to climb, because
    he was not so strong as his brothers. He lost his bread, fell
    often, and was exhausted when he got on firm ground. He began
    to climb the hill in the hottest part of the day. When he had
    climbed for an hour he was very thirsty, and lifted the bottle
    to drink a little water. As he did so he saw a feeble old man
    coming down the path toward him.</p>

    <p>"I am faint with thirst," said the old man; "will you give
    me some of that water?"</p>

    <p>Gluck saw that he was pale and tired, so he gave him the
    water, saying, "Please don't drink it all." But the old man
    drank a great deal, and gave back the bottle two-thirds
    emptied. Then he bade Gluck good speed, and Gluck went on
    merrily.</p>

    <p>Some grass appeared on the path, and the grasshoppers began
    to sing.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_81"
       id="Page_81"></a>At the end of another hour, Gluck felt that
       he must drink again. But, as he raised the flask, he saw a
       little child lying by the roadside, and it cried out
       pitifully for water. After a struggle with himself Gluck
       decided to bear the thirst a little longer. He put the
       bottle to the child's lips, and it drank all but a few
       drops. Then it got up and ran down the hill.</p>

    <p>All kinds of sweet flowers began to grow on the rocks, and
    crimson and purple butterflies flitted about in the air.</p>

    <p>At the end of another hour, Gluck's thirst was almost
    unbearable. He saw that there were only five or six drops of
    water in the bottle, however, and he did not dare to drink. So
    he was putting the flask away again when he saw a little dog on
    the rocks, gasping for breath. He looked at it, and then at the
    Golden River, and he remembered the dwarf's words, "No one can
    succeed except at the first trial"; and he tried to pass the
    dog. But it whined piteously, and Gluck stopped. He could not
    bear to pass it. "Confound the King and his gold, too!" he
    said; and he poured the few drops of water into the dog's
    mouth.</p>

    <p>The dog sprang up; its tail disappeared, its nose grew red,
    and its eyes twinkled. The next minute the dog was gone, and
    the King of the Golden River stood there. He stooped and
    plucked a lily that grew beside Gluck's feet.<a name="Page_82"
       id="Page_82"></a> Three drops of dew were on its white
       leaves. These the dwarf shook into the flask which Gluck
       held in his hand.</p>

    <p>"Cast these into the river," he said, "and go down the other
    side of the mountains into the Treasure Valley." Then he
    disappeared.</p>

    <p>Gluck stood on the brink of the Golden River, and cast the
    three drops of dew into the stream. Where they fell, a little
    whirlpool opened; but the water did not turn to gold. Indeed,
    the water seemed vanishing altogether. Gluck was disappointed
    not to see gold, but he obeyed the King of the Golden River,
    and went down the other side of the mountains.</p>

    <p>When he came out into the Treasure Valley, a river, like the
    Golden River, was springing from a new cleft in the rocks
    above, and flowing among the heaps of dry sand. And then fresh
    grass sprang beside the river, flowers opened along its sides,
    and vines began to cover the whole valley. The Treasure Valley
    was becoming a garden again.</p>

    <p>Gluck lived in the Valley, and his grapes were blue, and his
    apples were red, and his corn was yellow; and the poor were
    never driven from his door. For him, as the King had promised,
    the river was really a River of Gold.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />

    <p>It will probably be clear to anyone who has followed these
    attempts, that the first step in <a name="Page_83"
       id="Page_83"></a>adaptation is analysis, careful analysis of
       the story as it stands. One asks oneself, What is the story?
       Which events are necessary links in the chain? How much of
       the text is pure description?</p>

    <p>Having this essential body of the story in mind, one then
    decides which of the steps toward the climax are needed for
    safe arrival there, and keeps these. When two or more steps can
    be covered in a single stride, one makes the stride. When a
    necessary explanation is unduly long, or is woven into the
    story in too many strands, one disposes of it in an
    introductory statement, or perhaps in a side remark. If there
    are two or more threads of narrative, one chooses among them,
    and holds strictly to the one chosen, eliminating details which
    concern the others.</p>

    <p>In order to hold the simplicity of plot so attained, it is
    also desirable to have but few personages in the story, and to
    narrate the action from the point of view of one of
    them,&mdash;usually the hero. To shift the point of view of the
    action is confusing to the child's mind.</p>

    <p>When the analysis and condensation have been accomplished,
    the whole must be cast in simple language, keeping if possible
    the same kind of speech as that used in the original, but
    changing difficult or technical terms to plain, and complex
    images to simple and familiar ones.</p>

    <p>All types of adaptation share in this need of
    <a name="Page_84"
       id="Page_84"></a>simple language,&mdash;stories which are
       too short, as well as those which are too long, have this
       feature in their changed form. The change in a short story
       is applied oftenest where it becomes desirable to amplify a
       single anecdote, or perhaps a fable, which is told in very
       condensed form. Such an instance is the following anecdote
       of heroism, which in the original is quoted in one of F.W.
       Robertson's lectures on Poetry.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>A detachment of troops was marching along a valley, the
        cliffs overhanging which were crested by the enemy. A
        sergeant, with eleven men, chanced to become separated from
        the rest by taking the wrong side of a ravine, which they
        expected soon to terminate, but which suddenly deepened
        into an impassable chasm. The officer in command signalled
        to the party an order to return. They mistook the signal
        for a command to charge; the brave fellows answered with a
        cheer, and charged. At the summit of the steep mountain was
        a triangular platform, defended by a breastwork, behind
        which were seventy of the foe. On they went, charging up
        one of those fearful paths, eleven against seventy. The
        contest could not long be doubtful with such odds. One
        after another they fell; six upon the spot, the remainder
        hurled backwards; but not until they had slain nearly twice
        their own number.</p>

        <p>There is a custom, we are told, amongst the hillsmen,
        that when a great chieftain of their own falls in battle,
        his wrist is bound with a thread either of red or green,
        the red denoting the highest rank. According to custom,
        they stripped the dead, and threw their bodies over the
        precipice. When their comrades came, they found their
        corpses stark and gashed; but round both wrists of every
        British hero was twined the red thread!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="Page_85"
       id="Page_85"></a>This anecdote serves its purpose of
       illustration perfectly well, but considered as a separate
       story it is somewhat too explanatory in diction, and too
       condensed in form. Just as the long story is analysed for
       reduction of given details, so this must be
       analysed,&mdash;to find the details implied. We have to read
       into it again all that has been left between the lines.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the order must be slightly changed, if we are to
    end with the proper "snap," the final sting of surprise and
    admiration given by the point of the story; the point must be
    prepared for. The purpose of the original is equally well
    served by the explanation at the end, but we must never forget
    that the place for the climax, or effective point in a story
    told, is the last thing said. That is what makes a story "go
    off" well.</p>

    <p>Imagining vividly the situation suggested, and keeping the
    logical sequence of facts in mind, shall we not find the story
    telling itself to boys and girls in somewhat this form?</p>

    <p>This story which I am going to tell you is a true one. It
    happened while the English troops in India were fighting
    against some of the native <a name="Page_86"
       id="Page_86"></a>tribes. The natives who were making trouble
       were people from the hill-country, called Hillsmen, and they
       were strong enemies. The English knew very little about
       them, except their courage, but they had noticed one
       peculiar custom, after certain battles,&mdash;the Hillsmen
       had a way of marking the bodies of their greatest chiefs who
       were killed in battle by binding a red thread about the
       wrist; this was the highest tribute they could pay a hero.
       The English, however, found the common men of them quite
       enough to handle, for they had proved themselves good
       fighters and clever at ambushes.</p>

    <p>One day, a small body of the English had marched a long way
    into the hill country, after the enemy, and in the afternoon
    they found themselves in a part of the country strange even to
    the guides. The men moved forward very slowly and cautiously,
    for fear of an ambush. The trail led into a narrow valley with
    very steep, high, rocky sides, topped with woods in which the
    enemy might easily hide.</p>

    <p>Here the soldiers were ordered to advance more quickly,
    though with caution, to get out of the dangerous place.</p>

    <p>After a little they came suddenly to a place where the
    passage was divided in two by a big three-cornered boulder
    which seemed to rise from the midst of the valley. The main
    line of men kept to the right; to save crowding the
    <a name="Page_87"
       id="Page_87"></a>path, a sergeant and eleven men took the
       left, meaning to go round the rock and meet the rest beyond
       it.</p>

    <p>They had been in the path only a few minutes when they saw
    that the rock was not a single boulder at all, but an arm of
    the left wall of the valley, and that they were marching into a
    deep ravine with no outlet except the way they came. Both sides
    were sheer rock, almost perpendicular, with thick trees at the
    top; in front of them the ground rose in a steep hill, bare of
    woods. As they looked up, they saw that the top was barricaded
    by the trunks of trees, and guarded by a strong body of
    Hillsmen. As the English hesitated, looking at this, a shower
    of spears fell from the wood's edge, aimed by hidden foes. The
    place was a death trap.</p>

    <p>At this moment, their danger was seen by the officer in
    command of the main body, and he signalled to the sergeant to
    retreat.</p>

    <p>By some terrible mischance, the signal was misunderstood.
    The men took it for the signal to charge. Without a moment's
    pause, straight up the slope, they charged on the run, cheering
    as they ran.</p>

    <p>Some were killed by the spears that were thrown from the
    cliffs, before they had gone half way; some were stabbed as
    they reached the crest, and hurled backward from the precipice;
    two or three got to the top, and fought <a name="Page_88"
       id="Page_88"></a>hand to hand with the Hillsmen. They were
       outnumbered, seven to one; but when the last of the English
       soldiers lay dead, twice their number of Hillsmen lay dead
       around them!</p>

    <p>When the relief party reached the spot, later in the day,
    they found the bodies of their comrades, full of wounds,
    huddled over and in the barricade, or crushed on the rocks
    below. They were mutilated and battered, and bore every sign of
    the terrible struggle. <i>But round both wrists of every
    British soldier was bound the red thread!</i></p>

    <p>The Hillsmen had paid greater honour to their heroic foes
    than to the bravest of their own brave dead.</p>

    <p>Once upon a time a dormouse lived in the wood with his
    mother. She had made a snug little nest, but Sleepy-head, as
    she called her <a name="Page_89"
       id="Page_89"></a>little mousie, loved to roam about among
       the grass and fallen leaves, and it was a hard task to keep
       him at home. One day the mother went off as usual to look
       for food, leaving Sleepy-head curled up comfortably in a
       corner of the nest. "He will lie there safely till I come
       back," she thought. Presently, however, Sleepy-head opened
       his eyes and thought he would like to take a walk out in the
       fresh air. So he crept out of the nest and through the long
       grass that nodded over the hole in the bank. He ran here and
       he ran there, stopping again and again to cock his little
       ears for sound of any creeping thing that might be close at
       hand. His little fur coat was soft and silky as velvet.
       Mother had licked it clean before starting her day's work,
       you may be sure. As Sleepy-head moved from place to place
       his long tail swayed from side to side and tickled the
       daisies so that they could not hold themselves still for
       laughing.</p>

    <p>Presently something very cold fell on Sleepy-head's nose.
    What could it be? He put up his little paw and dabbed at the
    place. Then the same thing happened to his tail. He whisked it
    quickly round to the front. Ah, it was raining! Now Sleepy-head
    couldn't bear rain, and he had got a long way from home. What
    would mother say if his nice furry coat got wet and draggled?
    He crept under a bush, <a name="Page_90"
       id="Page_90"></a>but soon the rain found him out. Then he
       ran to a tree, but this was poor shelter. He began to think
       that he was in for a soaking when what should he spy, a
       little distance off, but a fine toadstool which stood bolt
       upright just like an umbrella. The next moment Sleepy-head
       was crawling underneath the friendly shelter. He fixed
       himself up as snugly as he could, with his little nose upon
       his paws and his little tail curled round all, and before
       you could count six, eight, ten, twenty, he was fast
       asleep.</p>

    <p>Now it happened that Sleepy-head was not the only creature
    that was caught by the rain that morning in the wood. A little
    elf had been flitting about in search of fun or mischief, and
    he, too, had got far from home when the raindrops began to come
    pattering through the leafy roof of the beautiful wood. It
    would never do to get his pretty wings wet, for he hated to
    walk&mdash;it was such slow work and, besides, he might meet
    some big wretched animal that could run faster than himself.
    However, he was beginning to think that there was no help for
    it, when, on a sudden, there before him was the toadstool, with
    Sleepy-head snug and dry underneath! There was room for another
    little fellow, thought the elf, and ere long he had safely
    bestowed himself under the other half of the toadstool, which
    was just like an umbrella.</p>

    <p>Sleepy-head slept on, warm and comfortable <a name="Page_91"
       id="Page_91"></a>in his furry coat, and the elf began to
       feel annoyed with him for being so happy. He was always a
       great mischief, and he could not bear to sit still for long
       at a time. Presently he laughed a queer little laugh. He had
       got an idea! Putting his two small arms round the stem of
       the toadstool he tugged and he pulled until, of a sudden,
       snap! He had broken the stem, and a moment later was soaring
       in air safely sheltered under the toadstool, which he held
       upright by its stem as he flew.</p>

    <p>Sleepy-head had been dreaming, oh, so cosy a dream! It
    seemed to him that he had discovered a storehouse filled with
    golden grain and soft juicy nuts with little bunches of
    sweet-smelling hay, where tired mousies might sleep dull hours
    away. He thought that he was settled in the sweetest bunch of
    all, with nothing in the world to disturb his nap, when
    gradually he became aware that something had happened. He shook
    himself in his sleep and settled down again, but the dream had
    altered. He opened his eyes. Rain was falling, pit-a-pat, and
    he was without cover on a wet patch of grass. What could be the
    matter? Sleepy-head was now wide awake. Said he,</p>

    <p>"DEAR ME, WHERE IS MY TOADSTOOL?"</p>

    <p>From these four instances we may, perhaps, deduce certain
    general principles of adaptation <a name="Page_92"
       id="Page_92"></a>which have at least proved valuable to
       those using them.</p>

    <p>These are suggestions which the practised story-teller will
    find trite. But to others they may prove a fair foundation on
    which to build a personal method to be developed by experience.
    I have given them a tabular arrangement below.</p>

    <p>Selection, and, if necessary, adaptation&mdash;these are the
    preliminaries to the act of telling. That, after all, is the
    real test of one's power. That is the real joy, when achieved;
    the real bugbear, when dreaded. And that is the subject of this
    chapter, "How to tell a story."</p>

    <p>How to tell a story: it is a short question which demands a
    long answer. The right beginning of the answer depends on a
    right conception of the thing the question is about; and that
    naturally reverts to an earlier discussion of the real nature
    of a story. In that discussion it was stated that a story is a
    work of art,&mdash;a message, as all works of art are.</p>

    <p>To tell a story, then, is to pass on the message, to share
    the work of art. The message may be merely one of
    humour,&mdash;of nonsense, even; works of art range all the way
    from the "Victory" to a "Dresden Shepherdess," from an
    "Assumption" to a "Broken Pitcher," and farther. Each has its
    own place. But whatever its quality, the story-teller is the
    passer-on, the <a name="Page_94"
       id="Page_94"></a>interpreter, the transmitter. He comes
       bringing a gift. Always he gives; always he bears a
       message.</p>

    <p>This granted, the first demand of the story-teller is not
    far to seek. No one can repeat a message he has not heard, or
    interpret what he does not understand. You cannot give, unless
    you first possess. The first demand of the story-teller is that
    he possess. He must <i>feel</i> the story. Whatever the
    particular quality and appeal of the work of art, from the
    lightest to the grandest emotion or thought, he must have
    responded to it, grasped it, felt it intimately, before he can
    give it out again. Listen, humbly, for the message.</p>

    <p>I realise that this has an incongruous sound, when applied
    to such stories as that of the little pig at the stile or of
    the greedy cat who ate up man and beast. But, believe me, it
    does apply even to those. For the transmittable thing in a
    story is the identifying essence, the characterising savour,
    the peculiar quality and point of view of the humour, pathos,
    or interest. Every tale which claims a place in good fiction
    has this identifying savour and quality, each different from
    every other. The laugh which echoes one of Seumas McManus's
    rigmaroles is not the chuckle which follows one of Joel
    Chandler Harris's anecdotes; the gentle sadness of an Andersen
    allegory is not the heart-<a name="Page_95"
       id="Page_95"></a>searching tragedy of a tale from the Greek;
       nor is any one story of an author just like any other of the
       same making. Each has its personal likeness, its facial
       expression, as it were.</p>

    <p>And the mind must be sensitised to these differences. No one
    can tell stories well who has not a keen and just feeling of
    such emotional values.</p>

    <p>A positive and a negative injunction depend on this
    premise,&mdash;the positive, cultivate your feeling, striving
    toward increasingly just appreciation; the negative, never tell
    a story you do not feel.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, the number and range of stories one can
    appreciate grow with cultivation; but it is the part of wisdom
    not to step outside the range at any stage of its growth.</p>

    <p>I feel the more inclined to emphasise this caution because I
    once had a rather embarrassing and pointed proof of its
    desirability,&mdash;which I relate for the enlightening of the
    reader.</p>

    <p>There is a certain nonsense tale which a friend used to tell
    with such effect that her hearers became helpless with
    laughter, but which for some reason never seemed funny to me. I
    could not laugh at it. But my friend constantly urged me to use
    it, quoting her own success. At last, with much curiosity and
    some trepidation, I included it in a programme before people
    with whom I was so closely in sympathy that no chill was likely
    to emanate from their side.<a name="Page_96"
       id="Page_96"></a> I told the story as well as I knew how,
       putting into it more genuine effort than most stories can
       claim. The audience smiled politely, laughed gently once or
       twice, relapsed into the mildest of amusement. The most one
       could say was that the story was not a hopeless failure. I
       tried it again, after study, and yet again; but the
       audiences were all alike. And in my heart I should have been
       startled if they had behaved otherwise, for all the time I
       was telling it I was conscious in my soul that it was a
       stupid story! At last I owned my defeat to myself, and put
       the thing out of mind.</p>

    <p>Some time afterward, I happened to take out the notes of the
    story, and idly looked them over; and suddenly, I do not know
    how, I got the point of view! The salt of the humour was all at
    once on my lips; I felt the tickle of the pure folly of it; it
    <i>was</i> funny.</p>

    <p>The next afternoon I told the story to a hundred or so
    children and as many mothers,&mdash;and the battle was won.
    Chuckles punctuated my periods; helpless laughter ran like an
    under-current below my narrative; it was a struggle for me to
    keep sober, myself. The nonsense tale had found its own
    atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Now of course I had known all along that the humour of the
    story emanated from its very exaggeration, its absurdly
    illogical smoothness. But I had not <i>felt</i> it. I did not
    really "see the <a name="Page_97"
       id="Page_97"></a>joke." And that was why I could not tell
       the story. I undoubtedly impressed my own sense of its
       fatuity on every audience to which I gave it. The case is
       very clear.</p>

    <p>Equally clear have been some happy instances where I have
    found audiences responding to a story I myself greatly liked,
    but which common appreciation usually ignored. This is an
    experience even more persuasive than the other, certainly more
    to be desired.</p>

    <p>Every story-teller has lines of limitation; certain types of
    story will always remain his or her best effort. There is no
    reason why any type of story should be told really ill, and of
    course the number of kinds one tells well increases with the
    growth of the appreciative capacity. But none the less, it is
    wise to recognise the limits at each stage, and not try to tell
    any story to which the honest inner consciousness says, "I do
    not like you."</p>

    <p>Let us then set down as a prerequisite for good
    story-telling, <i>a genuine appreciation of the story</i>.</p>

    <p>Now, we may suppose this genuine appreciation to be your
    portion. You have chosen a story, have felt its charm, and
    identified the quality of its appeal.</p>

    <p>You are now to tell it in such wise that your hearers will
    get the same kind of impression you yourself received from it.
    How?</p>

    <p><a name="Page_98"
       id="Page_98"></a>I believe the inner secret of success is
       the measure of force with which the teller wills the
       conveyance of his impression to the hearer.</p>

    <p>Anyone who has watched, or has himself been, the teller of a
    story which held an audience, knows that there is something
    approaching hypnotic suggestion in the close connection of
    effort and effect, and in the elimination of self-consciousness
    from speaker and listeners alike.</p>

    <p>I would not for a moment lend the atmosphere of charlatanry,
    or of the ultra-psychic, to the wholesome and vivid art of
    story-telling. But I would, if possible, help the teacher to
    realise how largely success in that art is a subjective and
    psychological matter, dependent on her control of her own mood
    and her sense of direct, intimate communion with the minds
    attending her. The "feel" of an audience,&mdash;that
    indescribable sense of the composite human soul waiting on the
    initiative of your own, the emotional currents interplaying
    along a medium so delicate that it takes the baffling torture
    of an obstruction to reveal its existence,&mdash;cannot be
    taught. But it can and does develop with use. And a realisation
    of the immense latent power of strong desire and resolution
    vitalises and disembarrasses the beginner.</p>

    <p>That is, undoubtedly, rather an intangible beginning; it
    sets the root of the matter somewhat in the realm of "spirits
    and influences."<a name="Page_99"
       id="Page_99"></a> There are, however, outward and visible
       means of arriving at results. Every art has its technique.
       The art of story-telling, intensely personal and subjective
       as it is, yet comes under the law sufficiently not to be a
       matter of sheer "knack." It has its technique. The following
       suggestions are an attempt to state what seem the foundation
       principles of that technique. The general statements are
       deduced from many consecutive experiences; partly, too, they
       are the results of introspective analysis, confirmed by
       observation. They do not make up an exclusive body of rules,
       wholly adequate to produce good work, of themselves; they do
       include, so far as my observation and experience allow, the
       fundamental requisites of good work,&mdash;being the
       qualities uniformly present in successful work of many
       story-tellers.</p>

    <p>First of all, most fundamental of all, is a rule without
    which any other would be but folly: <i>Know your story.</i></p>

    <p>One would think so obvious a preliminary might be taken for
    granted. But alas, even slight acquaintance with the average
    story-teller proves the dire necessity of the admonition. The
    halting tongue, the slip in name or incident, the turning back
    to forge an omitted link in the chain, the repetition, the
    general weakness of statement consequent on imperfect grasp:
    these are common features of the stories one hears
    <a name="Page_100"
       id="Page_100"></a>told. And they are features which will
       deface the best story ever told.</p>

    <p>One must know the story absolutely; it must have been so
    assimilated that it partakes of the nature of personal
    experience; its essence must be so clearly in mind that the
    teller does not have to think of it at all in the act of
    telling, but rather lets it flow from his lips with the
    unconscious freedom of a vivid reminiscence.</p>

    <p>Such knowledge does not mean memorising. Memorising utterly
    destroys the freedom of reminiscence, takes away the
    spontaneity, and substitutes a mastery of form for a mastery of
    essence. It means, rather, a perfect grasp of the gist of the
    story, with sufficient familiarity with its form to determine
    the manner of its telling. The easiest way to obtain this
    mastery is, I think, to analyse the story into its simplest
    elements of plot. Strip it bare of style, description,
    interpolation, and find out simply <i>what happened</i>.
    Personally, I find that I get first an especially vivid
    conception of the climax; this then has to be rounded out by a
    clear perception of the successive steps which lead up to the
    climax. One has, so, the framework of the story. The next
    process is the filling in.</p>

    <p>There must be many ways of going about this filling in.
    Doubtless many of my readers, in the days when it was their pet
    ambition to make a good recitation in school, evolved
    <a name="Page_101"
       id="Page_101"></a>personally effective ways of doing it; for
       it is, after all, the same thing as preparing a bit of
       history or a recitation in literature. But for the
       consideration of those who find it hard to gain mastery of
       fact without mastery of its stated form, I give my own way.
       I have always used the childlike plan of talking it out.
       Sometimes inaudibly, sometimes in loud and penetrating tones
       which arouse the sympathetic curiosity of my family, I tell
       it over and over, to an imaginary hearer. That hearer is as
       present to me, always has been, as Stevenson's "friend of
       the children" who takes the part of the enemy in their
       solitary games of war. His criticism (though he is a most
       composite double-sexed creature who should not have a
       designating personal pronoun) is all-revealing. For talking
       it out instantly brings to light the weak spots in one's
       recollection. "What was it the little crocodile said?" "Just
       how did the little pig get into his house?" "What was that
       link in the chain of circumstances which brought the wily
       fox to confusion?" The slightest cloud of uncertainty
       becomes obvious in a moment. And as obvious becomes one's
       paucity of expression, one's week-kneed imagination, one's
       imperfect assimilation of the spirit of the story. It is not
       a flattering process.</p>

    <p>But when these faults have been corrected <a name="Page_102"
       id="Page_102"></a>by several attempts, the method gives a
       confidence, a sense of sureness, which makes the real
       telling to a real audience ready and spontaneously smooth.
       Scarcely an epithet or a sentence comes out as it was in the
       preliminary telling; but epithets and sentences in
       sufficiency do come; the beauty of this method is that it
       brings freedom instead of bondage.</p>

    <p>A valuable exception to the rule against memorising must be
    noted here. Especially beautiful and indicative phrases of the
    original should be retained, and even whole passages, where
    they are identified with the beauty of the tale. And in stories
    like <i>The Three Bears</i> or <i>Red Riding Hood</i> the exact
    phraseology of the conversation as given in familiar versions
    should be preserved; it is in a way sacred, a classic, and not
    to be altered. But beyond this the language should be the
    teller's own, and probably never twice the same. Sureness,
    ease, freedom, and the effect of personal reminiscence come
    only from complete mastery. I repeat, with emphasis: Know your
    story.</p>

    <p>The next suggestion is a purely practical one concerning the
    preparation of physical conditions. See that the children are
    seated in close and direct range of your eye; the familiar
    half-circle is the best arrangement for small groups of
    children, but the teacher should be <a name="Page_103"
       id="Page_103"></a>at a point <i>opposite</i> the centre of
       the arc, <i>not in</i> its centre: thus,</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/i104a.png"
             alt="Arc A"
             title="Arc A" />
    </div>

    <p>not thus;</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/i104b.png"
             alt="Arc B"
             title="Arc B" />
    </div>

    <p>it is important also not to have the ends too far at the
    side, and to have no child directly behind another, or in such
    a position that he has not an easy view of the teacher's full
    face. Little children have to be physically close in order to
    be mentally close. It is, of course, desirable to obtain a
    hushed quiet before beginning; but it is not so important as to
    preserve your own mood of holiday, and theirs. If the fates and
    the atmosphere of the day are against you, it is wiser to trust
    to the drawing power of the tale itself, and abate the
    irritation of didactic methods. And never break into that magic
    tale, once begun, with an admonition to Ethel or Tommy to stop
    squirming, or a rebuke to "that little girl over there who is
    not listening." Make her listen! It is probably your fault if
    she is not. If you are telling a good story, and telling it
    well, she can't help listening,&mdash;unless she is an abnormal
    child; and if she is abnormal you ought not to spoil the mood
    of the others to attend to her.</p>

    <p>I say "never" interrupt your story; perhaps it is only fair
    to amend that, after the fashion of dear little Marjorie
    Fleming, and say "never&mdash;if you can help it." For, of
    course, there are exceptional occasions, and exceptional
    children; some <a name="Page_104"
       id="Page_104"></a>latitude must be left for the decisions of
       good common sense acting on the issue of the moment.</p>

    <p>The children ready, your own mood must be ready. It is
    desirable that the spirit of the story should be imposed upon
    the room from the beginning, and this result hangs on the
    clearness and intensity of the teller's initiatory mood. An act
    of memory and of will is the requisite. The story-teller must
    call up&mdash;it comes with the swiftness of thought&mdash;the
    essential emotion of the story as he felt it first. A single
    volition puts him in touch with the characters and the movement
    of the tale. This is scarcely more than a brief and condensed
    reminiscence; it is the stepping back into a mood once
    experienced.</p>

    <p>Let us say, for example, that the story to be told is the
    immortal fable of <i>The Ugly Duckling</i>. Before you open
    your lips the whole pathetic series of the little swan's
    mishaps should flash across your mind,&mdash;not accurately and
    in detail, but blended to a composite of undeserved ignominy,
    of baffled innocent wonderment, and of delicious underlying
    satire on average views. With this is mingled the feeling of
    Andersen's delicate whimsicality of style. The dear little Ugly
    Duckling waddles, bodily, into your consciousness, and you pity
    his sorrows and anticipate his triumph, before you begin.</p>

    <p>This preliminary recognition of mood is what brings the
    delicious quizzical twitch to the mouth <a name="Page_105"
       id="Page_105"></a>of a good raconteur who begins an anecdote
       the hearers know will be side-splitting. It is what makes
       grandmother sigh gently and look far over your heads, when
       her soft voice commences the story of "the little girl who
       lived long, long ago." It is a natural and instinctive thing
       with the born story-teller; a necessary thing for anyone who
       will become a story-teller.</p>

    <p>From the very start, the mood of the tale should be definite
    and authoritative, beginning with the mood of the teller and
    emanating therefrom in proportion as the physique of the teller
    is a responsive medium.</p>

    <p>Now we are off. Knowing your story, having your hearers well
    arranged, and being as thoroughly as you are able in the right
    mood, you begin to tell it. Tell it, then, simply, directly,
    dramatically, with zest.</p>

    <p><i>Simply</i> applies both to manner and matter. As to
    manner, I mean without affectation, without any form of
    pretence, in short, without posing. It is a pity to "talk down"
    to the children, to assume a honeyed voice, to think of the
    edifying or educational value of the work one is doing.
    Naturalness, being oneself, is the desideratum. I wonder why we
    so often use a preposterous voice,&mdash;a super-sweetened
    whine, in talking to children? Is it that the effort to realise
    an ideal of gentleness and affectionateness overreaches itself
    in this form of the grotesque?<a name="Page_106"
       id="Page_106"></a> Some good intention must be the root of
       it. But the thing is none the less pernicious. A "cant"
       voice is as abominable as a cant phraseology. Both are of
       the very substance of evil.</p>

    <p>"But it is easier to <i>say,</i> 'Be natural' than to
    <i>be</i> it," said one teacher to me desperately.</p>

    <p>Beyond dispute. To those of us who are cursed with an
    over-abundant measure of self-consciousness, nothing is harder
    than simple naturalness. The remedy is to lose oneself in one's
    art. Think of the story so absorbingly and vividly that you
    have no room to think of yourself. Live it. Sink yourself in
    that mood you have summoned up, and let it carry you.</p>

    <p>If you do this, simplicity of matter will come easily. Your
    choice of words and images will naturally become simple.</p>

    <p>It is, I think, a familiar precept to educators, that
    children should not have their literature too much simplified
    for them. We are told that they like something beyond them, and
    that it is good for them to have a sense of mystery and power
    beyond the sense they grasp. That may be true; but if so it
    does not apply to story-telling as it does to reading. We have
    constantly to remember that the movement of a story told is
    very swift. A concept not grasped in passing is irrevocably
    lost; there is no possibility of turning back, or lingering
    over the page. Also, since the art of story-telling is
    pri<a name="Page_107"
       id="Page_107"></a>marily an art of entertainment, its very
       object is sacrificed if the ideas and images do not slip
       into the child's consciousness smoothly enough to avoid the
       sense of strain. For this reason short, familiar, vivid
       words are best.</p>

    <p>Simplicity of manner and of matter are both essential to the
    right appeal to children.</p>

    <p><i>Directness</i> in telling is a most important quality.
    The story, listened to, is like the drama, beheld. Its movement
    must be unimpeded, increasingly swift, winding up "with a
    snap." Long-windedness, or talking round the story, utterly
    destroys this movement. The incidents should be told, one after
    another, without explanation or description beyond what is
    absolutely necessary; and <i>they should be told in logical
    sequence.</i> Nothing is more distressing than the
    cart-before-the-horse method,&mdash;nothing more quickly
    destroys interest than the failure to get a clue in the right
    place.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, to be sure, a side remark adds piquancy and a
    personal savour. But the general rule is, great discretion in
    this respect.</p>

    <p>Every epithet or adjective beyond what is needed to give the
    image, is a five-barred gate in the path of the eager mind
    travelling to a climax.</p>

    <p>Explanations and moralising are usually sheer clatter. Some
    few stories necessarily include a little explanation, and
    stories of the fable <a name="Page_108"
       id="Page_108"></a>order may quaintly end with an obvious
       moral. But here again, the rule is&mdash;great
       discretion.</p>

    <p>It is well to remember that you have one great advantage
    over the writer of stories. The writer must present a clear
    image and make a vivid impression,&mdash;all with words. The
    teller has face, and voice, and body to do it with. The teller
    needs, consequently, but one swiftly incisive verb to the
    writer's two; but one expressive adjective to his three. Often,
    indeed, a pause and an expressive gesture do the whole
    thing.</p>

    <p>It may be said here that it is a good trick of description
    to repeat an epithet or phrase once used, when referring again
    to the same thing. The recurrent adjectives of Homer were the
    device of one who entertained a childlike audience. His trick
    is unconscious and instinctive with people who have a natural
    gift for children's stories. Of course this matter also demands
    common sense in the degree of its use; in moderation it is a
    most successful device.</p>

    <p>Brevity, close logical sequence, exclusion of foreign
    matter, unhesitant speech,&mdash;to use these is to tell a
    story directly.</p>

    <p>After simplicity and directness, comes that quality which to
    advise, is to become a rock of offence to many. It is the
    suggestion, "Tell the story <i>dramatically</i>." Yet when we
    quite understand each other as to the meaning
    of<a name="Page_109"
       id="Page_109"></a> "dramatically," I think you will agree
       with me that a good story-teller includes this in his
       qualities of manner. It means, not in the manner of the
       elocutionist, not excitably, not any of the things which are
       incompatible with simplicity and sincerity; but with a
       whole-hearted throwing of oneself into the game, which
       identifies one in a manner with the character or situation
       of the moment. It means responsively, vividly, without
       interposing a blank wall of solid self between the drama of
       the tale and the mind's eye of the audience.</p>

    <p>It is such fun, pure and simple, so to throw oneself into
    it, and to see the answering expressions mimic one's own, that
    it seems superfluous to urge it. Yet many persons do find it
    difficult. The instant, slight but suggestive change of voice,
    the use of onomatopoetic words, the response of eyes and hands,
    which are all immediate and spontaneous with some temperaments,
    are to others a matter of shamefacedness and labour. To those,
    to all who are not by nature bodily expressive, I would
    reiterate the injunction already given,&mdash;not to pretend.
    Do nothing you cannot do naturally and happily. But lay your
    stress on the inner and spiritual effort to appreciate, to
    feel, to imagine out the tale; and let the expressiveness of
    your body grow gradually with the increasing freedom from
    crippling self-<a name="Page_110"
       id="Page_110"></a>consciousness. The physique will become
       more mobile as the emotion does.</p>

    <p>The expression must, however, always <i>remain suggestive
    rather than illustrative</i>. This is the side of the case
    which those who are over-dramatic must not forget. The
    story-teller is not playing the parts of his stories; he is
    merely arousing the imagination of his hearers to picture the
    scenes for themselves. One element of the dual consciousness of
    the tale-teller remains always the observer, the reporter, the
    quiet outsider.</p>

    <p>I like to think of the story-teller as a good fellow
    standing at a great window overlooking a busy street or a
    picturesque square, and reporting with gusto to the comrade in
    the rear of the room what of mirth or sadness he sees; he hints
    at the policeman's strut, the organ-grinder's shrug, the
    schoolgirl's gaiety, with a gesture or two which is born of an
    irresistible impulse to imitate; but he never leaves his
    fascinating post to carry the imitation further than a
    hint.</p>

    <p>The verity of this figure lies in the fact that the dramatic
    quality of story-telling depends closely upon the <i>clearness
    and power with which the story-teller visualises the events and
    characters he describes</i>. You must hold the image before the
    mind's eye, using your imagination to embody to yourself every
    act, incident and appear<a name="Page_111"
       id="Page_111"></a>ance. You must, indeed, stand at the
       window of your consciousness and watch what happens.</p>

    <p>This is a point so vital that I am tempted to put it in
    ornate type. You must <i>see</i> what you <i>say</i>!</p>

    <p>It is not too much, even, to say, "You must see more than
    you say." True vividness is lent by a background of picture
    realised by the listener beyond what you tell him. Children
    see, as a rule, no image you do not see; they see most clearly
    what you see most largely. Draw, then, from a full well, not
    from a supply so low that the pumps wheeze at every pull.</p>

    <p>Dramatic power of the reasonably quiet and suggestive type
    demanded for telling a story will come pretty surely in the
    train of effort along these lines; it follows the clear concept
    and sincerity in imparting it, and is a natural consequence of
    the visualising imagination.</p>

    <p>It is inextricably bound up, also, with the causes and
    results of the quality which finds place in my final
    injunction, to tell your story <i>with zest</i>. It might
    almost be assumed that the final suggestion renders the
    preceding one superfluous, so direct is the effect of a lively
    interest on the dramatic quality of a narration; but it would
    not of itself be adequate; the necessity of visualising
    imagination is paramount. Zest is, however, a close second to
    this clearness of mental vision. It is entirely
    <a name="Page_112"
       id="Page_112"></a>necessary to be interested in your own
       story, to enjoy it as you tell it. If you are bored and
       tired, the children will soon be bored and tired, too. If
       you are not interested your manner cannot get that vitalised
       spontaneity which makes dramatic power possible. Nothing
       else will give that relish on the lips, that gusto, which
       communicates its joy to the audience and makes it receptive
       to every impression. I used to say to teachers, "Tell your
       story with all your might," but I found that this by a
       natural misconception was often interpreted to mean
       "laboriously." And of course nothing is more injurious to
       the enjoyment of an audience than obvious effort on the part
       of the entertainer. True zest can be&mdash;often
       is&mdash;extremely quiet, but it gives a savour nothing else
       can impart.</p>

    <p>"But how, at the end of a hard morning's work, can I be
    interested in a story I have told twenty times before?" asks
    the kindergarten or primary teacher, not without reason.</p>

    <p>There are two things to be said. The first is a reminder of
    the wisdom of choosing stories in which you originally have
    interest; and of having a store large enough to permit variety.
    The second applies to those inevitable times of weariness which
    attack the most interested and well-stocked story-teller. You
    are, perhaps, tired out physically. You have told a certain
    story <a name="Page_113"
       id="Page_113"></a>till it seems as if a repetition of it
       must produce bodily effects dire to contemplate, yet that
       happens to be the very story you must tell. What can you do?
       I answer, "Make believe." The device seems incongruous with
       the repeated warnings against pretence; but it is necessary,
       and it is wise. Pretend as hard as ever you can to be
       interested. And the result will be&mdash;before you know
       it&mdash;that you will <i>be</i> interested. That is the
       chief cause of the recommendation; it brings about the
       result it simulates. Make believe, as well as you know how,
       and the probability is that you will not even know when the
       transition from pretended to real interest comes.</p>

    <p>And fortunately, the children never know the difference.
    They have not that psychological infallibility which is often
    attributed to them. They might, indeed, detect a pretence which
    continued through a whole tale; but that is so seldom necessary
    that it needs little consideration.</p>

    <p>So then: enjoy your story; be interested in it,&mdash;if you
    possibly can; and if you cannot, pretend to be, till the very
    pretence brings about the virtue you have assumed.</p>

    <p>There is much else which might be said and urged regarding
    the method of story-telling, even without encroaching on the
    domain of personal variations. A whole chapter might, for
    example, be devoted to voice and enunciation, and then
    <a name="Page_114"
       id="Page_114"></a>leave the subject fertile. But voice and
       enunciation are after all merely single manifestations of
       degree and quality of culture, of taste, and of natural
       gift. No set rules can bring charm of voice and speech to a
       person whose feeling and habitual point of view are
       fundamentally wrong; the person whose habitual feeling and
       mental attitude are fundamentally right needs few or no
       rules. As the whole matter of story-telling is in the first
       instance an expression of the complex personal product, so
       will this feature of it vary in perfection according to the
       beauty and culture of the human mechanism manifesting
       it.</p>

    <p>A few generally applicable suggestions may, however, be
    useful,&mdash;always assuming the story-teller to have the
    fundamental qualifications of fine and wholesome habit. These
    are not rules for the art of speaking; they are merely some
    practical considerations regarding speaking to an audience.</p>

    <p>First, I would reiterate my earlier advice, be simple.
    Affectation is the worst enemy of voice and enunciation alike.
    Slovenly enunciation is certainly very dreadful, but the
    unregenerate may be pardoned if they prefer it to the affected
    mouthing which some over-nice people without due sense of
    values expend on every syllable which is so unlucky as to fall
    between their teeth.</p>

    <p>Next I would urge avoidance of a fault very
    <a name="Page_115"
       id="Page_115"></a>common with those who speak much in large
       rooms,&mdash;the mistaken effort at loudness. This results
       in tightening and straining the throat, finally producing
       nasal head-tones or a voice of metallic harshness. And it is
       entirely unnecessary. There is no need to speak loudly. The
       ordinary schoolroom needs no vocal effort. A hall seating
       three or four hundred persons demands no effort whatever
       beyond a certain clearness and definiteness of speech. A
       hall seating from five to eight hundred needs more skill in
       aiming the voice, but still demands no shouting.</p>

    <p>It is indeed largely the psychological quality of a tone
    that makes it reach in through the ear to the comprehension.
    The quiet, clear, restful, persuasive tone of a speaker who
    knows his power goes straight home; but loud speech confuses.
    Never speak loudly. In a small room, speak as gently and easily
    as in conversation; in a large room, think of the people
    farthest away, and speak clearly, with a slight separation
    between words, and with definite phrasing,&mdash;aiming your
    <i>mind</i> toward the distant listeners.</p>

    <p>If one is conscious of nasality or throatiness of voice, it
    certainly pays to study the subject seriously with an
    intelligent teacher. But a good, natural speaking-voice, free
    from extraordinary vices, will fill all the requirements of
    story-telling to small audiences, without other
    <a name="Page_116"
       id="Page_116"></a>attention than comes indirectly from
       following the general principles of the art.</p>

    <p>To sum it all up, then, let us say of the method likely to
    bring success in telling stories, that it includes sympathy,
    grasp, spontaneity: one must appreciate the story, and know it;
    and then, using the realising imagination as a constant
    vivifying force, and dominated by the mood of the story, one
    must tell it with all one's might,&mdash;simply, vitally,
    joyously.</p>

    <h2>SOME SPECIFIC SCHOOLROOM USES OF STORY-TELLING</h2>

    <p>In Chapter II., I have tried to give my conception of the
    general aim of story-telling in school. From that conception,
    it is not difficult to deduce certain specific uses. The one
    most plainly intimated is that of a brief recreation period, a
    feature which has proved valuable in many classes. Less
    definitely implied, but not to be ignored, was the use of the
    story during, or accessory to, the lesson in science or
    history.</p>

    <p>But more distinctive and valuable than these, I think, is a
    specific use which I have recently had the pleasure of seeing
    exemplified in great completeness in the schools of Providence,
    Rhode Island.</p>

    <p>Some four years ago, the assistant superintendent of schools
    of that city, Miss Ella L. Sweeney, introduced a rather unusual
    and extended application of the story in her primary classes.
    While the experiment was in its early stages, it was my good
    fortune to be allowed to make suggestions for its development,
    and as the devices in question were those I had been
    <a name="Page_118"
       id="Page_118"></a>accustomed to use as a pastime for
       children, I was able to take some slight hand in the
       formative work of its adoption as an educational method.
       Carried out most ably by the teachers to whom it was
       entrusted, the plan has evolved into a more inclusive and
       systematic one than was at first hoped for; it is one from
       which I have been grateful to learn.</p>

    <p>Tersely stated, the object of the general plan is the
    freeing and developing of the power of expression in the
    pupils.</p>

    <p>I think there can be no need of dwelling on the desirability
    of this result. The apathy and "woodenness" of children under
    average modes of pedagogy is apparent to anyone who is
    interested enough to observe. In elementary work, the most
    noticeable lack of natural expression is probably in the
    reading classes; the same drawback appears at a later stage in
    English composition. But all along the line every thoughtful
    teacher knows how difficult it is to obtain spontaneous,
    creative reaction on material given.</p>

    <p>Story-telling has a real mission to perform in setting free
    the natural creative expression of children, and in vitalising
    the general atmosphere of the school. The method in use for
    this purpose in Providence (and probably elsewhere, as ideas
    usually germinate in more than one place at once) is a
    threefold <i>giving back</i> of <a name="Page_119"
       id="Page_119"></a>the story by the children. Two of the
       forms of reproduction are familiar to many teachers; the
       first is the obvious one of telling the story back
       again.</p>

    <p>It is such fun to listen to a good story that children
    remember it without effort, and later, when asked if they can
    tell the story of <i>The Red-Headed Woodpecker</i> or <i>The
    Little Red Hen</i>, they are as eager to try it as if it were a
    personal experience which they were burning to impart.</p>

    <p>Each pupil, in the Providence classes, is given a chance to
    try each story, at some time. Then that one which each has told
    especially well is allotted to him for his own particular
    story, on which he has an especial claim thereafter.</p>

    <p>It is surprising to note how comparatively individual and
    distinctive the expression of voice and manner becomes, after a
    short time. The child instinctively emphasises the points which
    appeal to him, and the element of fun in it all helps to bring
    forgetfulness of self. The main inflections and the general
    tenor of the language, however, remain imitative, as is natural
    with children. But this is a gain rather than otherwise, for it
    is useful in forming good habit. In no other part of her work,
    probably, has a teacher so good a chance to foster in her
    pupils pleasant habits of enunciation and voice. And this is
    especially worth while in the big <a name="Page_120"
       id="Page_120"></a>city schools, where so many children come
       from homes where the English of the tenement is spoken.</p>

    <p>I have since wished that every city primary teacher could
    have visited with me the first-grade room in Providence where
    the pupils were German, Russian, or Polish Jews, and where some
    of them had heard no English previous to that year,&mdash;it
    being then May. The joy that shone on their faces was nothing
    less than radiance when the low-voiced teacher said, "Would you
    like to tell these ladies some of your stories?"</p>

    <p>They told us their stories, and there was truly not one told
    poorly or inexpressively; all the children had learned
    something of the joy of creative effort. But one little fellow
    stands out in my memory beyond all the rest, yet as a type of
    all the rest.</p>

    <p>Rudolph was very small, and square, and merry of eye; life
    was one eagerness and expectancy to him. He knew no English
    beyond that of one school year. But he stood staunchly in his
    place and told me the story of the Little Half Chick with an
    abandon and bodily emphasis which left no doubt of his
    sympathetic understanding of every word. The depth of moral
    reproach in his tone was quite beyond description when he said,
    "Little Half Chick, little Half Chick, when <i>I</i> was in
    trubbul <a name="Page_121"
       id="Page_121"></a>you wouldn't help <i>me</i>!" He heartily
       relished that repetition, and became more dramatic each
       time.</p>

    <p>Through it all, in the tones of the tender little voice, the
    sidewise pose of the neat dark head, and the occasional use of
    a chubby pointing finger, one could trace a vague reflection of
    the teacher's manner. It was not strong enough to dominate at
    all over the child's personality, but it was strong enough to
    suggest possibilities.</p>

    <p>In different rooms, I was told <i>The Half Chick</i>, <i>The
    Little Red Hen</i>, <i>The Three Bears</i>, <i>The Red-Headed
    Woodpecker</i>, <i>The Fox and the Grapes</i>, and many other
    simple stories, and in every instance there was a noticeable
    degree of spontaneity and command of expression.</p>

    <p>When the reading classes were held, the influence of this
    work was very visible. It had crept into the teachers' method,
    as well as the children's attitude. The story interest was
    still paramount. In the discussion, in the teachers' remarks,
    and in the actual reading, there was a joyousness and an
    interest in the subject-matter which totally precluded that
    preoccupation with sounds and syllables so deadly to any real
    progress in reading. There was less of the mechanical in the
    reading than in any I had heard in my visits to schools; but it
    was exceptionally accurate.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_122"
       id="Page_122"></a>The second form of giving back which has
       proved a keen pleasure and a stimulus to growth is a kind of
       "seat-work." The children are allowed to make original
       illustrations of the stories by cutting silhouette
       pictures.</p>

    </div>

    <p>It will be readily seen that no child can do this without
    visualising each image very perfectly. In the simplest and most
    unconscious way possible, the small artists are developing the
    power of conceiving and holding the concrete image of an idea
    given, the power which is at the bottom of all arts of
    expression.</p>

    <p>Through the kindness of Miss Sweeney, I am able to insert
    several of these illustrations. They are entirely original, and
    were made without any thought of such a use as this.</p>

    <p>The pictures and the retelling are both popular with
    children, but neither is as dear to them as the third form of
    reproduction of which I wish to speak. This third kind is taken
    entirely on the ground of play, and no visibly didactic element
    enters into it. It consists simply of <i>playing the
    story</i>.</p>

    <p>When a good story with a simple sequence has been told, and
    while the children are still athrill with the delight of it,
    they are told they may play it.</p>

    <p>"Who would like to be Red Riding Hood?" says the teacher; up
    go the little girls' hands, and Mary or Hannah or Gertrude is
    chosen.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_123"
       id="Page_123"></a><a name="Page_124"
       id="Page_124"></a>Who will be the wolf?" Johnny or Marcus
       becomes the wolf. The kind woodchopper and the mother are
       also happily distributed, for in these little dramatic
       companies it is an all-star cast, and no one realises any
       indignity in a subordinate <i>r&ocirc;le</i>.</p>

    <p>"Now, where shall we have little Red Riding Hood's house?
    'Over in that corner,' Katie? Very well, Riding Hood shall live
    over there. And where shall the grandmother's cottage be?"</p>

    <p>The children decide that it must be a long distance through
    the wood,&mdash;half-way round the schoolroom, in fact. The
    wolf selects the spot where he will meet Red Riding Hood, and
    the woodchopper chooses a position from which he can rush in at
    the critical moment, to save Red Riding Hood's life.</p>

    <p>Then, with gusto good to see, they play the game. The
    teacher makes no suggestions; each actor creates his part. Some
    children prove extremely expressive and facile, while others
    are limited by nature. But each is left to his spontaneous
    action.</p>

    <p>In the course of several days several sets of children have
    been allowed to try; then if any of them are notably good in
    the several <i>r&ocirc;les</i>, they are given an especial
    privilege in that story, as was done with the retelling. When a
    child expresses a part badly, the teacher sometimes asks if
    anyone thinks of another <a name="Page_125"
       id="Page_125"></a><a name="Page_126"
       id="Page_126"></a>way to do it; from different examples
       offered, the children then choose the one they prefer; this
       is adopted. At no point is the teacher apparently teaching.
       She lets the audience teach itself and its actors.</p>

    <p>The children played a good many stories for me during my
    visit in Providence. Of them all, <i>Red Riding Hood</i>,
    <i>The Fox and the Grapes</i>, and <i>The Lion and the
    Mouse</i> were most vividly done.</p>

    <p>It will be long before the chief of the Little Red Riding
    Hoods fades from my memory. She had a dark, foreign little
    face, with a good deal of darker hair tied back from it, and
    brown, expressive hands. Her eyes were so full of dancing
    lights that when they met mine unexpectedly it was as if a
    chance reflection had dazzled me. When she was told that she
    might play, she came up for her riding hood like an embodied
    delight, almost dancing as she moved. (Her teacher used a few
    simple elements of stage-setting for her stories, such as bowls
    for the Bears, a cape for Riding Hood, and so on.)</p>

    <p>The game began at once. Riding Hood started from the rear
    corner of the room, basket on arm; her mother gave her strict
    injunctions as to lingering on the way, and she returned a
    respectful "Yes, mother." Then she trotted round the aisle,
    greeting the wood<a name="Page_127"
       id="Page_127"></a><a name="Page_128"
       id="Page_128"></a>chopper on the way, to the deep wood which
       lay close by the teacher's desk. There master wolf was
       waiting, and there the two held converse,&mdash;master wolf
       very crafty indeed, Red Riding Hood extremely polite. The
       wolf then darted on ahead and crouched down in the corner
       which represented grandmother's bed. Riding Hood tripped
       sedately to the imaginary door, and knocked. The familiar
       dialogue followed, and with the words "the better to eat you
       with, my dear!" the wolf clutched Red Riding Hood, to eat
       her up. But we were not forced to undergo the threatened
       scene of horrid carnage, as the woodchopper opportunely
       arrived, and stated calmly, "I will not let you kill Little
       Red Riding Hood."</p>

    <p>All was now happily culminated, and with the chopper's grave
    injunction as to future conduct in her ears, the rescued
    heroine tiptoed out of the woods, to her seat.</p>

    <p>I wanted to applaud, but I realised in the nick of time that
    we were all playing, and held my peace.</p>

    <p><i>The Fox and the Grapes</i> was more dramatically done,
    but was given by a single child. He was the chosen "fox" of
    another primary room, and had the fair colouring and sturdy
    frame which matched his Swedish name. He was naturally
    dramatic. It was easy to see that he instinctively visualised
    everything, and <a name="Page_129"
       id="Page_129"></a><a name="Page_130"
       id="Page_130"></a>this he did so strongly that he suggested
       to the onlooker every detail of the scene.</p>

    <p>He chose for his grape-trellis the rear wall of the
    room.</p>

    <p>Standing there, he looked longingly up at the invisible
    bunch of grapes. "My gracious," he said, "what fine grapes! I
    will have some."</p>

    <p>Then he jumped for them.</p>

    <p>"Didn't get them," he muttered, "I'll try again," and he
    jumped higher.</p>

    <p>"Didn't get them this time," he said disgustedly, and hopped
    up once more. Then he stood still, looked up, shrugged his
    shoulders, and remarked in an absurdly worldly-wise tone,
    "Those grapes are sour!" After which he walked away.</p>

    <p>Of course the whole thing was infantile, and without a touch
    of grace; but it is no exaggeration to say that the child did
    what many grown-up actors fail to do,&mdash;he preserved the
    illusion.</p>

    <p>It was in still another room that I saw the lion and mouse
    fable played.</p>

    <p>The lion lay flat on the floor for his nap, but started up
    when he found his paw laid on the little mouse, who crouched as
    small as she could beside him. (The mouse was by nature rather
    larger than the lion, but she called what art she might to her
    assistance.) The <a name="Page_131"
       id="Page_131"></a>mouse persuaded the lion to lift his paw,
       and ran away.</p>

    <p>Presently a most horrific groaning emanated from the lion.
    The mouse ran up, looked him over, and soliloquised in precise
    language,&mdash;evidently remembered, "What is the matter with
    the lion? Oh, I see; he is caught in a trap." And then she
    gnawed with her teeth at the imaginary rope which bound
    him.</p>

    <p>"What makes you so kind to me, little Mouse?" said the
    rescued lion.</p>

    <p>"You let me go, when I asked you," said the mouse
    demurely.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, little Mouse," answered the lion; and therewith,
    finis.</p>

    <p>It is not impossible that all this play atmosphere may seem
    incongruous and unnecessary to teachers used to more
    conventional methods, but I feel sure that an actual experience
    of it would modify that point of view conclusively. The
    children of the schools where story-telling and "dramatising"
    were practised were startlingly better in reading, in
    attentiveness, and in general power of expression, than the
    pupils of like social conditions in the same grades of other
    cities which I visited soon after, and in which the more
    conventional methods were exclusively used. The teachers, also,
    were stronger in power of expression.</p>

    <p>But the most noticeable, though the least <a name="Page_132"
       id="Page_132"></a>tangible, difference was in the moral
       atmosphere of the schoolroom. There had been a great gain in
       vitality in all the rooms where stories were a part of the
       work. It had acted and reacted on pupils and teachers alike.
       The telling of a story well so depends on being thoroughly
       vitalised that, naturally, habitual telling had resulted in
       habitual vitalisation.</p>

    <p>This result was not, of course, wholly due to the practice
    of story-telling, but it was in some measure due to that. And
    it was a result worth the effort.</p>

    <p>I beg to urge these specific uses of stories, as both
    recreative and developing, and as especially tending toward
    enlarged power of expression: retelling the story; illustrating
    the story in seat-work; dramatisation.</p>

    red ones at all, any yellow ones, or any pink ones,&mdash;only
    white roses.</p>

    <p>And one morning, very early, a little white rosebud woke up,
    and saw the sun looking at her. He stared so hard that the
    little white rosebud did not know what to do; so she looked up
    at him and said, "Why are you looking at me so hard?"</p>

    <p>"Because you are so pretty!" said the big round sun. And the
    little white rosebud blushed! She blushed pink. And all her
    children after her were little pink roses!</p>

    <p>Once there was a little furry rabbit, who lived with his
    mother deep down in a nest under the <a name="Page_136"
       id="Page_136"></a>long grass. His name was Raggylug, and his
       mother's name was Molly Cottontail. Every morning, when
       Molly Cottontail went out to hunt for food, she said to
       Raggylug, "Now, Raggylug, lie still, and make no noise. No
       matter what you hear, no matter what you see, don't you
       move. Remember you are only a baby rabbit, and lie low." And
       Raggylug always said he would.</p>

    <p>One day, after his mother had gone, he was lying very still
    in the nest, looking up through the feathery grass. By just
    cocking his eye, so, he could see what was going on up in the
    world. Once a big blue-jay perched on a twig above him, and
    scolded someone very loudly; he kept saying, "Thief! thief!"
    But Raggylug never moved his nose, nor his paws; he lay still.
    Once a lady-bird took a walk down a blade of grass, over his
    head; she was so top-heavy that pretty soon she tumbled off and
    fell to the bottom, and had to begin all over again. But
    Raggylug never moved his nose nor his paws; he lay still.</p>

    <p>The sun was warm, and it was very still.</p>

    <p>Suddenly Raggylug heard a little sound, far off. It sounded
    like "Swish, swish," very soft and far away. He listened. It
    was a queer little sound, low down in the grass,
    "rustle&mdash;rustle&mdash;rustle"; Raggylug was interested.
    But he never moved his nose or his paws; he lay still. Then the
    sound came nearer, "rustle&mdash;rustle&mdash;rustle"; then
    grew fainter, then came <a name="Page_137"
       id="Page_137"></a>nearer; in and out, nearer and nearer,
       like something coming; only, when Raggylug heard anything
       coming he always heard its feet, stepping ever so softly.
       What could it be that came so
       smoothly,&mdash;rustle&mdash;rustle&mdash;without any
       feet?</p>

    <p>He forgot his mother's warning, and sat up on his hind paws;
    the sound stopped then. "Pooh," thought Raggylug, "I'm not a
    baby rabbit, I am three weeks old; I'll find out what this is."
    He stuck his head over the top of the nest, and
    looked&mdash;straight into the wicked eyes of a great big
    snake. "Mammy, Mammy!" screamed Raggylug. "Oh, Mammy,
    Mam&mdash;" But he couldn't scream any more, for the big snake
    had his ear in his mouth and was winding about the soft little
    body, squeezing Raggylug's life out. He tried to call "Mammy!"
    again, but he could not breathe.</p>

    <p>Ah, but Mammy had heard the first cry. Straight over the
    fields she flew, leaping the stones and hummocks, fast as the
    wind, to save her baby. She wasn't a timid little cottontail
    rabbit then; she was a mother whose child was in danger. And
    when she came to Raggylug and the big snake, she took one look,
    and then hop! hop! she went over the snake's back; and as she
    jumped she struck at the snake with her strong hind claws so
    that they tore his skin. He hissed with rage, but he did not
    let go.</p>

    <p>Hop! hop! she went again, and this time she
    <a name="Page_138"
       id="Page_138"></a>hurt him so that he twisted and turned;
       but he held on to Raggylug.</p>

    <p>Once more the mother rabbit hopped, and once more she struck
    and tore the snake's back with her sharp claws. Zzz! How she
    hurt! The snake dropped Raggy to strike at her, and Raggy
    rolled on to his feet and ran.</p>

    <p>"Run, Raggylug, run!" said his mother, keeping the snake
    busy with her jumps; and you may believe Raggylug ran! Just as
    soon as he was out of the way his mother came too, and showed
    him where to go. When she ran, there was a little white patch
    that showed under her tail; that was for Raggy to
    follow,&mdash;he followed it now.</p>

    <p>Far, far away she led him, through the long grass, to a
    place where the big snake could not find him, and there she
    made a new nest. And this time, when she told Raggylug to lie
    low you'd better believe he minded!</p>

        [1]</span></a> This story was told me in the mother-tongue
        of a German friend, at the kindly instance of a common
        friend of both; the narrator had heard it at home from the
        lips of a father of story-loving children for whom he often
        invented such little tales. The present adaptation has
        passed by hearsay through so many minds that it is perhaps
        little like the original, but I venture to hope it has a
        touch of the original fancy, at least.</p>
    </div>

    <p>I am going to tell you a story about something wonderful
    that happened to a Christmas<a name="Page_139"
       id="Page_139"></a> Tree like this, ever and ever so long
       ago, when it was once upon a time.</p>

    <p>It was before Christmas, and the tree was trimmed with
    bright spangled threads and many-coloured candles and (name the
    trimmings of the tree before you), and it stood safely out of
    sight in a room where the doors were locked, so that the
    children should not see it before the proper time. But ever so
    many other little house-people had seen it. The big black pussy
    saw it with her great green eyes; the little grey kitty saw it
    with her little blue eyes; the kind house-dog saw it with his
    steady brown eyes; the yellow canary saw it with his wise,
    bright eyes. Even the wee, wee mice that were so afraid of the
    cat had peeped one peep when no one was by.</p>

    <p>But there was someone who hadn't seen the Christmas tree. It
    was the little grey spider!</p>

    <p>You see, the spiders lived in the corners,&mdash;the warm
    corners of the sunny attic and the dark corners of the nice
    cellar. And they were expecting to see the Christmas Tree as
    much as anybody. But just before Christmas a great cleaning-up
    began in the house. The house-mother came sweeping and dusting
    and wiping <a name="Page_140"
       id="Page_140"></a>and scrubbing, to make everything grand
       and clean for the Christ-child's birthday. Her broom went
       into all the corners, poke, poke,&mdash;and of course the
       spiders had to run. Dear, dear, <i>how</i> the spiders had
       to run! Not one could stay in the house while the Christmas
       cleanness lasted. So, you see, they couldn't see the
       Christmas Tree.</p>

    <p>Spiders like to know all about everything, and see all there
    is to see, and these were very sad. So at last they went to the
    Christ-child and told him about it.</p>

    <p>"All the others see the Christmas Tree, dear Christ-child,"
    they said; "but we, who are so domestic and so fond of
    beautiful things, we are <i>cleaned up</i>! We cannot see it,
    at all."</p>

    <p>The Christ-child was sorry for the little spiders when he
    heard this, and he said they should see the Christmas Tree.</p>

    <p>The day before Christmas, when nobody was noticing, he let
    them all go in, to look as long as ever they liked.</p>

    <p>They came creepy, creepy, down the attic stairs, creepy,
    creepy, up the cellar stairs, creepy, creepy, along the
    halls,&mdash;and into the beautiful room. The fat mother
    spiders and the old papa spiders were there, and all the little
    teeny, tiny, curly spiders, the baby ones. And then they
    looked! Round and round the tree they crawled, and looked and
    looked and <a name="Page_141"
       id="Page_141"></a>looked. Oh, what a good time they had!
       They thought it was perfectly beautiful. And when they had
       looked at everything they could see from the floor, they
       started up the tree to see more. All over the tree they ran,
       creepy, crawly, looking at every single thing. Up and down,
       in and out, over every branch and twig, the little spiders
       ran, and saw every one of the pretty things right up
       close.</p>

    <p>They stayed till they had seen all there was to see, you may
    be sure, and then they went away at last, <i>quite</i>
    happy.</p>

    <p>Then, in the still, dark night before Christmas Day, the
    dear Christ-child came, to bless the tree for the children. But
    when he looked at it&mdash;<i>what</i> do you suppose?&mdash;it
    was covered with cobwebs! Everywhere the little spiders had
    been they had left a spider-web; and you know they had been
    everywhere. So the tree was covered from its trunk to its tip
    with spider-webs, all hanging from the branches and looped
    round the twigs; it was a strange sight.</p>

    <p>What could the Christ-child do? He knew that house-mothers
    do not like cobwebs; it would never, never do to have a
    Christmas Tree covered with those. No, indeed.</p>

    <p>So the dear Christ-child touched the spider's webs, and
    turned them all to gold! Wasn't that a lovely trimming? They
    shone and shone, all over the beautiful tree. And that is the
    way <a name="Page_142"
       id="Page_142"></a>the Christmas Tree came to have golden
       cobwebs on it.</p>

    <p>Once the Morning-Glory was flat on the ground. She grew that
    way, and she had never climbed at all. Up in the top of a tree
    near her lived Mrs Jennie Wren and her little baby Wren. The
    little Wren was lame; he had a broken wing and couldn't fly. He
    stayed in the nest all day. But the mother Wren told him all
    about what she saw in the world, when she came flying home at
    night. She used to tell him about the beautiful Morning-Glory
    she saw on the ground. She told him about the Morning-Glory
    every day, until the little Wren was filled with a desire to
    see her for himself.</p>

    <p>"How I wish I could see the Morning-Glory!" he said.</p>

    <p>The Morning-Glory heard this, and she longed to let the
    little Wren see her face. She pulled herself along the ground,
    a little at a time, until she was at the foot of the tree where
    the little Wren lived. But she could not get any farther,
    because she did not know how to climb. At last she wanted to go
    up so <a name="Page_143"
       id="Page_143"></a>much, that she caught hold of the bark of
       the tree, and pulled herself up a little. And little by
       little, before she knew it, she was climbing.</p>

    <p>And she climbed right up the tree to the little Wren's nest,

    <p>This is the story an Indian woman told a little white boy
    who lived with his father and mother near the Indians' country;
    and Tavwots is the name of the little rabbit.</p>

    <p>But once, long ago, Tavwots was not little,&mdash;he was the
    largest of all four-footed things, and a mighty hunter. He used
    to hunt every day; as soon as it was day, and light enough to
    see, he used to get up, and go to his hunting. But every day he
    saw the track of a great foot on the trail, before him. This
    troubled him, for his pride was as big as his body.</p>

    <p>"Who is this," he cried, "that goes before me to the
    hunting, and makes so great a stride? Does he think to put me
    to shame?"</p>

    <p>"T'-sst!" said his mother, "there is none greater than
    thou."</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_144"
       id="Page_144"></a>Still, there are the footprints in the
       trail,' said Tavwots.</p>

    <p>And the next morning he got up earlier; but still the great
    footprints and the mighty stride were before him. The next
    morning he got up still earlier; but there were the mighty
    foot-tracks and the long, long stride.</p>

    <p>"Now I will set me a trap for this impudent fellow," said
    Tavwots, for he was very cunning. So he made a snare of his
    bowstring and set it in the trail overnight.</p>

    <p>And when in the morning he went to look, behold, he had
    caught the sun in his snare! All that part of the earth was
    beginning to smoke with the heat of it.</p>

    <p>"Is it you who made the tracks in my trail?" cried
    Tavwots.</p>

    <p>"It is I," said the sun; "come and set me free, before the
    whole earth is afire."</p>

    <p>Then Tavwots saw what he had to do, and he drew his sharp
    hunting-knife and ran to cut the bowstring. But the heat was so
    great that he ran back before he had done it; and when he ran
    back he was melted down to half his size! Then the earth began
    to burn, and the smoke curled up against the sky.</p>

    <p>"Come again, Tavwots," cried the sun.</p>

    <p>And Tavwots ran again to cut the bowstring. But the heat was
    so great that he ran back <a name="Page_145"
       id="Page_145"></a>before he had done it, and be was melted
       down to a quarter of his size!</p>

    <p>"Come again, Tavwots, and quickly," cried the sun, "or all
    the world will be burnt up."</p>

    <p>And Tavwots ran again; this time he cut the bowstring and
    set the sun free. But when he got back he was melted down to
    the size he is now! Only one thing is left of all his
    greatness: you may still see by the print of his feet as he
    leaps in the trail, how great his stride was when he caught the
    sun in his snare.</p>

    <p>There was once a child who was untidy. He left his books on
    the floor, and his muddy shoes on the table; he put his fingers
    in the jam pots, and spilled ink on his best pinafore; there
    was really no end to his untidiness.</p>

    <p>One day the Tidy Angel came into his nursery.</p>

    <p>"This will never do!" said the Angel. "This is really
    shocking. You must go out and stay with your brother while I
    set things to rights here."</p>

    <p>"I have no brother!" said the child.</p>

    <p>"Yes, you have," said the Angel. "You may not know him, but
    he will know you. Go out <a name="Page_146"
       id="Page_146"></a>in the garden and watch for him, and he
       will soon come."</p>

    <p>"I don't know what you mean!" said the child; but he went
    out into the garden and waited.</p>

    <p>Presently a squirrel came along, whisking his tail.</p>

    <p>"Are you my brother?" asked the child.</p>

    <p>The squirrel looked him over carefully.</p>

    <p>"Well, I should hope not!" he said. "My fur is neat and
    smooth, my nest is handsomely made, and in perfect order, and
    my young ones are properly brought up. Why do you insult me by
    asking such a question?"</p>

    <p>He whisked off, and the child waited.</p>

    <p>Presently a wren came hopping by.</p>

    <p>"Are you my brother?" asked the child.</p>

    <p>"No, indeed!" said the wren. "What impertinence! You will
    find no tidier person than I in the whole garden. Not a feather
    is out of place, and my eggs are the wonder of all for
    smoothness and beauty. Brother, indeed!" He hopped off,
    ruffling his feathers, and the child waited.</p>

    <p>By-and-by a large Tommy Cat came along.</p>

    <p>"Are you my brother?" asked the child.</p>

    <p>"Go and look at yourself in the glass," said the Tommy Cat
    haughtily, "and you will have your answer. I have been washing
    myself in the sun all the morning, while it is clear that no
    <a name="Page_147"
       id="Page_147"></a>water has come near you for a long time.
       There are no such creatures as you in my family, I am humbly
       thankful to say."</p>

    <p>He walked on, waving his tail, and the child waited.</p>

    <p>Presently a pig came trotting along.</p>

    <p>The child did not wish to ask the pig if he were his
    brother, but the pig did not wait to be asked.</p>

    <p>"Hallo, brother!" he grunted.</p>

    <p>"I am not your brother!" said the child.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes, you are!" said the pig. "I confess I am not proud
    of you, but there is no mistaking the members of our family.
    Come along, and have a good roll in the barnyard! There is some
    lovely black mud there."</p>

    <p>"I don't like to roll in mud!" said the child.</p>

    <p>"Tell that to the hens!" said the Pig Brother. "Look at your
    hands and your shoes, and your pinafore! Come along, I say! You
    may have some of the pig-wash for supper, if there is more than
    I want."</p>

    <p>"I don't want pig-wash!" said the child; and he began to
    cry.</p>

    <p>Just then the Tidy Angel came out.</p>

    <p>"I have set everything to rights," she said, "and so it must
    stay. Now, will you go with the Pig Brother, or will you come
    back with me, and be a tidy child?"</p>

    <p>"With you, with you!" cried the child; and he clung to the
    Angel's dress.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_148"
       id="Page_148"></a>The Pig Brother grunted.</p>

    <p>"Small loss!" he said. "There will be all the more wash for

    <p>Once I made a pleasure trip to a country called Germany; and
    I went to a funny little town, where all the streets ran
    uphill. At the top there was a big mountain, steep like the
    roof of a house, and at the bottom there was a big river, broad
    and slow. And the funniest thing about the little town was that
    all the shops had the same thing in them; bakers' shops,
    grocers' shops, everywhere we went we saw the same
    thing,&mdash;big chocolate rats, rats and mice, made out of
    chocolate. We were so surprised that after a while, "Why do you
    have rats in your shops?" we asked.</p>

    <p>"Don't you know this is Hamelin town?" they said. "What of
    that?" said we. "Why, Hamelin town is where the Pied Piper
    came," they told us; "surely you know about the Pied Piper?"
    "<i>What</i> about the Pied Piper?" we said. And this is what
    they told us about him.</p>

    <p>It seems that once, long, long ago, that little town was
    dreadfully troubled with rats. The houses were full of them,
    the shops were full of <a name="Page_150"
       id="Page_150"></a>them, the churches were full of them, they
       were <i>everywhere</i>. The people were all but eaten out of
       house and home. Those rats,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>They fought the dogs and killed the
            cats,<br /></span> <span class="i2">And bit the babies
            in the cradles,<br /></span> <span>And ate the cheeses
            out of the vats,<br /></span> <span class="i2">And
            licked the soup from the cooks' own
            ladles,<br /></span> <span>Split open the kegs of
            salted sprats,<br /></span> <span>Made nests inside
            men's Sunday hats,<br /></span> <span>And even spoiled
            the women's chats<br /></span> <span class="i2">By
            drowning their speaking<br /></span>
            <span class="i2">With shrieking and
            squeaking<br /></span> <span>In fifty different sharps
            and flats!<br /></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>At last it got so bad that the people simply couldn't stand
    it any longer. So they all came together and went to the town
    hall, and they said to the Mayor (you know what a mayor is?),
    "See here, what do we pay you your salary for? What are you
    good for, if you can't do a little thing like getting rid of
    these rats? You must go to work and clear the town of them;
    find the remedy that's lacking, or&mdash;we'll send you
    packing!"</p>

    <p>Well, the poor Mayor was in a terrible way. What to do he
    didn't know. He sat with his head in his hands, and thought and
    thought and thought.</p>

    <p>Suddenly there came a little <i>rat-tat</i> at the door. Oh!
    how the Mayor jumped! His poor old heart went pit-a-pat at
    anything like the <a name="Page_151"
       id="Page_151"></a>sound of a rat. But it was only the
       scraping of shoes on the mat. So the Mayor sat up, and said,
       "Come in!"</p>

    <p>And in came the strangest figure! It was a man, very tall
    and very thin, with a sharp chin and a mouth where the smiles
    went out and in, and two blue eyes, each like a pin; and he was
    dressed half in red and half in yellow&mdash;he really was the
    strangest fellow!&mdash;and round his neck he had a long red
    and yellow ribbon, and on it was hung a thing something like a
    flute, and his fingers went straying up and down it as if he
    wanted to be playing.</p>

    <p>He came up to the Mayor and said, "I hear you are troubled
    with rats in this town."</p>

    <p>"I should say we were," groaned the Mayor.</p>

    <p>"Would you like to get rid of them? I can do it for
    you."</p>

    <p>"You can?" cried the Mayor. "How? Who are you?"</p>

    <p>"Men call me the Pied Piper," said the man, "and I know a
    way to draw after me everything that walks, or flies, or swims.
    What will you give me if I rid your town of rats?"</p>

    <p>"Anything, anything," said the Mayor. "I don't believe you
    can do it, but if you can, I'll give you a thousand
    guineas."</p>

    <p>"All right," said the Piper, "it is a bargain."</p>

    <p>And then he went to the door and stepped out into the street
    and stood, and put the long <a name="Page_152"
       id="Page_152"></a>flute-like thing to his lips, and began to
       play a little tune. A strange, high, little tune. And
       before</p>

    <p>From street to street he piped, advancing, from street to
    street they followed, dancing. Up one street and down another,
    till they came to the edge of the big river, and there the
    piper turned sharply about and stepped aside, and all those
    rats tumbled hurry skurry, head over heels, down the bank into
    the river <i>and&mdash;were&mdash;drowned</i>. Every single
    one. No, there was one big old fat rat; he was so fat he didn't
    sink, and he swam across, and ran away to tell the tale.</p>

    <p>Then the Piper came back to the town hall. And all the
    people were waving their hats and shouting for joy. The Mayor
    said they would have a big celebration, and build a tremendous
    <a name="Page_153"
       id="Page_153"></a>bonfire in the middle of the town. He
       asked the Piper to stay and see the bonfire,&mdash;very
       politely.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said the Piper, "that will be very nice; but first,
    if you please, I should like my thousand guineas."</p>

    <p>"H'm,&mdash;er&mdash;ahem!" said the Mayor. "You mean that
    little joke of mine; of course that was a joke." (You see it is
    always harder to pay for a thing when you no longer need
    it.)</p>

    <p>"I do not joke," said the Piper very quietly; "my thousand
    guineas, if you please."</p>

    <p>"Oh, come, now," said the Mayor, "you know very well it
    wasn't worth sixpence to play a little tune like that; call it
    one guinea, and let it go at that."</p>

    <p>"A bargain is a bargain," said the Piper; "for the last
    time,&mdash;will you give me my thousand guineas?"</p>

    <p>"I'll give you a pipe of tobacco, something good to eat, and
    call you lucky at that!" said the Mayor, tossing his head.</p>

    <p>Then the Piper's mouth grew strange and thin, and sharp blue
    and green lights began dancing in his eyes, and he said to the
    Mayor very softly, "I know another tune than that I played; I
    play it to those who play me false."</p>

    <p>"Play what you please! You can't frighten me! Do your
    worst!" said the Mayor, making himself big.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_154"
       id="Page_154"></a>Then the Piper stood high up on the steps
       of the town hall, and put the pipe to his lips, and began to
       play a little tune. It was quite a different little tune,
       this time, very soft and sweet, and very, very strange. And
       before he had played three notes, you heard</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Stop, stop!" cried the people. "He is taking our children!
    Stop him, Mr Mayor!"</p>

    <p>"I will give you your money, I will!" cried the Mayor, and
    tried to run after the Piper.</p>

    <p>But the very same music that made the children dance made
    the grown-up people stand stock-still; it was as if their feet
    had been tied to the ground; they could not move a muscle.
    There they stood and saw the Piper move slowly down the street,
    playing his little tune, with the children at his heels. On and
    on he went; on and on the children danced; till he came to the
    bank of the river.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_155"
       id="Page_155"></a>Oh, oh! He will drown our children in the
       river!" cried the people. But the Piper turned and went
       along by the bank, and all the children followed after. Up,
       and up, and up the hill they went, straight toward the
       mountain which is like the roof of a house. And just as they
       got to it, the mountain <i>opened</i>,&mdash;like two great
       doors, and the Piper went in through the opening, playing
       the little tune, and the children danced after
       him&mdash;and&mdash;just as they got through&mdash;the great
       doors slid together again and shut them all in! Every single
       one. No, there was one little lame child, who couldn't keep
       up with the rest and didn't get there in time. But none of
       his little companions ever came back any more, not one.</p>

    <p>But years and years afterward, when the fat old rat who swam
    across the river was a grandfather, his children used to ask
    him, "What made you follow the music, Grandfather?" and he used
    to tell them, "My dears, when I heard that tune I thought I
    heard the moving aside of pickle-tub boards, and the leaving
    ajar of preserve cupboards, and I smelled the most delicious
    old cheese in the world, and I saw sugar barrels ahead of me;
    and then, just as a great yellow cheese seemed to be saying,
    'Come, bore me'&mdash;I felt the river rolling o'er me!"</p>

    <p>And in the same way the people asked the little lame child,
    "What made you follow <a name="Page_156"
       id="Page_156"></a>the music?" "I do not know what the others
       heard," he said, "but I, when the Piper began to play, I
       heard a voice that told of a wonderful country hard by,
       where the bees had no stings and the horses had wings, and
       the trees bore wonderful fruits, where no one was tired or
       lame, and children played all day; and just as the beautiful
       country was but one step away&mdash;the mountain closed on
       my playmates, and I was left alone."</p>

    <p>That was all the people ever knew. The children never came
    back. All that was left of the Piper and the rats was just the
    big street that led to the river; so they called it the Street
    of the Pied Piper.</p>

    <p>And that is the end of the story.</p>

    <p>One day, a long, long time ago, it was very cold; winter was
    coming. And all the birds flew away to the warm south, to wait
    for the spring. But one little bird had a broken wing and could
    not fly. He did not know what to do. He looked all round, to
    see if there was any place where he could keep warm. And he saw
    the trees of the great forest.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_157"
       id="Page_157"></a>Perhaps the trees will keep me warm
       through the winter," he said.</p>

    <p>So he went to the edge of the forest, hopping and fluttering
    with his broken wing. The first tree he came to was a slim
    silver birch.</p>

    <p>"Beautiful birch-tree," he said, "will you let me live in
    your warm branches until the springtime comes?"</p>

    <p>"Dear me!" said the birch-tree, "what a thing to ask! I have
    to take care of my own leaves through the winter; that is
    enough for me. Go away."</p>

    <p>The little bird hopped and fluttered with his broken wing
    until he came to the next tree. It was a great, big
    oak-tree.</p>

    <p>"O big oak-tree," said the little bird, "will you let me
    live in your warm branches until the springtime comes?"</p>

    <p>"Dear me," said the oak-tree, "what a thing to ask! If you
    stay in my branches all winter you will be eating my acorns. Go
    away."</p>

    <p>So the little bird hopped and fluttered with his broken wing
    till he came to the willow-tree by the edge of the brook.</p>

    <p>"O beautiful willow-tree," said the little bird, "will you
    let me live in your warm branches until the springtime
    comes?"</p>

    <p>"No, indeed," said the willow-tree; "I never speak to
    strangers. Go away."</p>

    <p>The poor little bird did not know where to
    <a name="Page_158"
       id="Page_158"></a>go; but he hopped and fluttered along with
       his broken wing. Presently the spruce-tree saw him, and
       said, "Where are you going, little bird?"</p>

    <p>"I do not know," said the bird; "the trees will not let me
    live with them, and my wing is broken so that I cannot
    fly."</p>

    <p>"You may live on one of my branches," said the spruce; "here
    is the warmest one of all."</p>

    <p>"But may I stay all winter?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," said the spruce; "I shall like to have you."</p>

    <p>The pine-tree stood beside the spruce, and when he saw the
    little bird hopping and fluttering with his broken wing, he
    said, "My branches are not very warm, but I can keep the wind
    off because I am big and strong."</p>

    <p>So the little bird fluttered up into the warm branch of the
    spruce, and the pine-tree kept the wind off his house; then the
    juniper-tree saw what was going on, and said that she would
    give the little bird his dinner all the winter, from her
    branches. Juniper berries are very good for little birds.</p>

    <p>The little bird was very comfortable in his warm nest
    sheltered from the wind, with juniper berries to eat.</p>

    <p>The trees at the edge of the forest remarked upon it to each
    other:</p>

    <p>"I wouldn't take care of a strange bird," said the
    birch.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_159"
       id="Page_159"></a>I wouldn't risk my acorns," said the
       oak.</p>

    <p>"I would not speak to strangers," said the willow. And the
    three trees stood up very tall and proud.</p>

    <p>That night the North Wind came to the woods to play. He
    puffed at the leaves with his icy breath, and every leaf he
    touched fell to the ground. He wanted to touch every leaf in
    the forest, for he loved to see the trees bare.</p>

    <p>"May I touch every leaf?" he said to his father, the Frost
    King.</p>

    <p>"No," said the Frost King, "the trees which were kind to the
    bird with the broken wing may keep their leaves."</p>

    <p>So North Wind had to leave them alone, and the spruce, the
    pine, and the juniper-tree kept their leaves through all the
    winter. And they have done so ever since.</p>

    <p>There was once a little girl who was very, very poor. Her
    father and mother had died, and at last she had no little room
    to stay in, and no little bed to sleep in, and nothing more to
    eat except one piece of bread. So she said a prayer, put on her
    little jacket and her hood, <a name="Page_160"
       id="Page_160"></a>and took her piece of bread in her hand,
       and went out into the world.</p>

    <p>When she had walked a little way, she met an old man, bent
    and thin. He looked at the piece of bread in her hand, and
    said, "Will you give me your bread, little girl? I am very
    hungry." The little girl said, "Yes," and gave him her piece of
    bread.</p>

    <p>When she had walked a little farther she came upon a child,
    sitting by the path, crying. "I am so cold!" said the child.
    "Won't you give me your little hood, to keep my head warm?" The
    little girl took off her hood and tied it on the child's head.
    Then she went on her way.</p>

    <p>After a time, as she went, she met another child. This one
    shivered with the cold, and she said to the little girl, "Won't
    you give me your jacket, little girl?" And the little girl gave
    her her jacket. Then she went on again.</p>

    <p>By-and-by she saw another child, crouching almost naked by
    the wayside. "O little girl," said the child, "won't you give
    me your dress? I have nothing to keep me warm." So the little
    girl took off her dress and gave it to the other child. And now
    she had nothing left but her little shirt. It grew dark, and
    the wind was cold, and the little girl crept into the woods, to
    sleep for the night. But in the woods a child stood, weeping
    and naked. "I am cold," she <a name="Page_161"
       id="Page_161"></a>said, "give me your little shirt!" And the
       little girl thought, "It is dark, and the woods will shelter
       me; I will give her my little shirt"; so she did, and now
       she had nothing left in all the world.</p>

    <p>She stood looking up at the sky, to say her night-time
    prayer. As she looked up, the whole skyful of stars fell in a
    shower round her feet. There they were, on the ground, shining
    bright, and round. The little girl saw that they were silver
    dollars. And in the midst of them was the finest little shirt,
    all woven out of silk! The little girl put on the little silk
    shirt, and gathered the star dollars; and she was rich, all the
    days of her life.</p>

    <p>Far away in Central Africa, that vast land where dense
    forests and wild beasts abound, the shades of night were once
    more descending, warning all creatures that it was time to seek
    repose.</p>

    <p>All day long the sun had been like a great burning eye, but
    now, after painting the western sky with crimson and scarlet
    and gold, he had disappeared into his fleecy bed; the various
    <a name="Page_162"
       id="Page_162"></a>creatures of the forest had sought their
       holes and resting-places; the last sound had rumbled its
       rumble, the last bee had mumbled his mumble, and the last
       bear had grumbled his grumble; even the grasshoppers that
       had been chirruping, chirruping, through all the long hours
       without a pause, at length had ceased their shrill music,
       tucked up their long legs, and given themselves to
       slumber.</p>

    <p>There on a nodding grass-blade, a tiny Gnat had made a
    swinging couch, and he too had folded his wings, closed his
    tiny eyes, and was fast asleep. Darker, darker, darker became
    the night until the darkness could almost be felt, and over all
    was a solemn stillness as though some powerful finger had been
    raised, and some potent voice had whispered, "HU&mdash;SH!"</p>

    <p>Just when all was perfectly still, there came suddenly from
    the far away depths of the forest, like the roll of thunder, a
    mighty ROAR&mdash;R&mdash;R&mdash;R!</p>

    <p>In a moment all the beasts and birds were wide awake, and
    the poor little Gnat was nearly frightened out of his little
    senses, and his little heart went pit-a-pat. He rubbed his
    little eyes with his feelers, and then peered all around trying
    to penetrate the deep gloom as he whispered in
    terror&mdash;<i>"What&mdash;was&mdash;that?"</i></p>

    <p>What do <i>you</i> think it was?... Yes, a LION! A great,
    big lion who, while most other <a name="Page_163"
       id="Page_163"></a>denizens of the forest slept, was out
       hunting for prey. He came rushing and crashing through the
       thick undergrowth of the forest, swirling his long tail and
       opening wide his great jaws, and as he rushed he
       RO-AR-R-R-ED!</p>

    <p>Presently he reached the spot where the little Gnat hung
    panting at the tip of the waving grass-blade. Now the little
    Gnat was not afraid of lions, so when he saw it was only a
    lion, he cried out&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Hi, stop, stop! What are you making that horrible noise
    about?"</p>

    <p>The Lion stopped short, then backed slowly and regarded the
    Gnat with scorn.</p>

    <p>"Why, you tiny, little, mean, insignificant creature you,
    how DARE you speak to ME?" he raged.</p>

    <p>"How dare I speak to you?" repeated the Gnat quietly. "By
    the virtue of <i>right</i>, which is always greater than
    <i>might</i>. Why don't you keep to your own part of the
    forest? What right have you to be here, disturbing folks at
    this time of night?"</p>

    <p>By a mighty effort the Lion restrained his anger&mdash;he
    knew that to obtain mastery over others one must be master over
    oneself.</p>

    <p>"What <i>right</i>?" he repeated in dignified tones.
    "<i>Because I'm King of the Forest.</i> That's why. I can do no
    wrong, for all the other creatures of the forest are afraid of
    me. I DO what I please,<a name="Page_164"
       id="Page_164"></a> I SAY what I please, I EAT whom I please,
       I GO where I please&mdash;simply because I'm King of the
       Forest."</p>

    <p>"But who told you you were King?" demanded the Gnat. "Just
    answer me that!"</p>

    <p>"Who told ME?" roared the Lion. "Why, everyone acknowledges
    it&mdash;don't I tell you that everyone is afraid of me?"</p>

    <p>"Indeed!" cried the Gnat disdainfully. "Pray don't say
    <i>all</i>, for I'm not afraid of you. And further, I deny your
    right to be King."</p>

    <p>This was too much for the Lion. He now worked himself into a
    perfect fury.</p>

    <p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;YOU deny my right as King?"</p>

    <p>"I <i>do</i>, and, what is more, you shall never be King
    until you have fought and conquered me."</p>

    <p>The Lion laughed a great lion laugh, and a lion laugh cannot
    be laughed at like a cat laugh, as everyone ought to know.</p>

    <p>"Fight&mdash;did you say fight?" he asked. "Who ever heard
    of a lion fighting a gnat? Here, out of my way, you atom of
    nothing! I'll blow you to the other end of the world."</p>

    <p>But though the Lion puffed his cheeks until they were like
    great bellows, and then blew with all his might, he could not
    disturb the little Gnat's hold on the swaying grass-blade.</p>

    <p>"You'll blow all your whiskers away if you are not careful,"
    he said, with a laugh&mdash;"but you won't move me. And if you
    dare leave this <a name="Page_165"
       id="Page_165"></a>spot without fighting me, I'll tell all
       the beasts of the forest that you are afraid of me, and
       they'll make <i>me</i> King."</p>

    <p>"Ho, ho!" roared the Lion. "Very well, since you will fight,
    let it be so."</p>

    <p>"You agree to the conditions, then? The one who conquers
    shall be King?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, certainly," laughed the Lion, for he expected an easy
    victory. "Are you ready?"</p>

    <p>"Quite ready."</p>

    <p>"Then&mdash;GO!" roared the Lion.</p>

    <p>And with that he sprang forward with open jaws, thinking he
    could easily swallow a million gnats. But just as the great
    jaws were about to close upon the blade of grass whereto the
    Gnat clung, what should happen but that the Gnat suddenly
    spread his wings and nimbly flew&mdash;where do you
    think?&mdash;right into one of the Lion's nostrils! And there
    he began to sting, sting, sting. The Lion wondered, and
    thundered, and blundered&mdash;but the Gnat went on stinging;
    he foamed, and he moaned, and he groaned&mdash;still the Gnat
    went on stinging; he rubbed his head on the ground in agony, he
    swirled his tail in furious passion, he roared, he spluttered,
    he sniffed, he snuffed&mdash;and still the Gnat went on
    stinging.</p>

    <p>"O my poor nose, my nose, my nose!" the Lion began to moan.
    "Come down, come DOWN, come <big>DOWN!</big> My nose, my NOSE,
    my<a name="Page_166"
       id="Page_166"></a> <big>NOSE!!</big> You're King of the
       Forest, you're King, you're King&mdash;only come down. My
       nose, my NOSE, my <big>NOSE!</big>"</p>

    <p>So at last the Gnat flew out from the Lion's nostril and
    went back to his waving grass-blade, while the Lion slunk away
    into the depths of the forest with his tail between his
    legs&mdash;<i>beaten</i>, and by a tiny Gnat!</p>

    <p>"What a fine fellow am I, to be sure!" exclaimed the Gnat,
    as he proudly plumed his wings. "I've beaten a lion&mdash;a
    lion! Dear me, I ought to have been King long ago, I'm so
    clever, so big, so strong&mdash;<i>oh!</i>"</p>

    <p>The Gnat's frightened cry was caused by finding himself
    entangled in some silky sort of threads. While gloating over
    his victory, the wind had risen, and his grass-blade had swayed
    violently to and fro unnoticed by him. A stronger gust than
    usual had bent the blade downward close to the ground, and then
    something caught it and held it fast and with it the victorious
    Gnat. Oh, the desperate struggles he made to get free! Alas! he
    became more entangled than ever. You can guess what it
    was&mdash;a spider's web, hung out from the overhanging branch
    of a tree. Then&mdash;flipperty-flopperty, flipperty-flopperty,
    flop, flip, flop&mdash;down his stairs came cunning Father
    Spider and quickly gobbled up the little Gnat for his supper,
    and that was the end of him.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_167"
       id="Page_167"></a>A strong Lion&mdash;and what overcame him?
       <i>A Gnat.</i></p>

    <p>A clever Gnat&mdash;and what overcame him? <i>A Spider's
    web!</i> He who had beaten the strong lion had been overcome by
    the subtle snare of a spider's thread.</p>

    <p>Once there was a cat, and a parrot. And they had agreed to
    ask each other to dinner, turn and turn about: first the cat
    should ask the parrot, then the parrot should invite the cat,
    and so on. It was the cat's turn first.</p>

    <p>Now the cat was very mean. He provided nothing at all for
    dinner except a pint of milk, a little slice of fish, and a
    biscuit. The parrot was too polite to complain, but he did not
    have a very good time.</p>

    <p>When it was his turn to invite the cat, he cooked a fine
    dinner. He had a roast of meat, a pot of tea, a basket of
    fruit, and, best of all, he baked a whole clothes-basketful of
    little cakes!&mdash;little, brown, crispy, spicy cakes! Oh, I
    should say as many as five hundred. And he put four hundred and
    ninety-eight of the cakes before the cat, keeping only two for
    himself.</p>

    <p>Well, the cat ate the roast, and drank the tea, and sucked
    the fruit, and then he began on the pile of cakes. He ate all
    the four hundred and ninety-eight cakes, and then he looked
    round and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_169"
       id="Page_169"></a>I'm hungry; haven't you anything to
       eat?"</p>

    <p>"Why," said the parrot, "here are my two cakes, if you want
    them?"</p>

    <p>The cat ate up the two cakes, and then he licked his chops
    and said, "I am beginning to get an appetite; have you anything
    to eat?"</p>

    <p>"Well, really," said the parrot, who was now rather angry,
    "I don't see anything more, unless you wish to eat me!" He
    thought the cat would be ashamed when he heard that&mdash;but
    the cat just looked at him and licked his chops
    again,&mdash;and slip! slop! gobble! down his throat went the
    parrot!</p>

    <p>Then the cat started down the street. An old woman was
    standing by, and she had seen the whole thing, and she was
    shocked that the cat should eat his friend. "Why, cat!" she
    said, "how dreadful of you to eat your friend the parrot!"</p>

    <p>"Parrot, indeed!" said the cat. "What's a parrot to
    me?&mdash;I've a great mind to eat you, too." And&mdash;before
    you could say "Jack Robinson"&mdash;slip! slop! gobble! down
    went the old woman!</p>

    <p>Then the cat started down the road again, walking like this,
    because he felt so fine. Pretty soon he met a man driving a
    donkey. The man was beating the donkey, to hurry him up, and
    when he saw the cat he said, "Get out <a name="Page_170"
       id="Page_170"></a>of my way, cat; I'm in a hurry and my
       donkey might tread on you."</p>

    <p>"Donkey, indeed!" said the cat, "much I care for a donkey! I
    have eaten five hundred cakes, I've eaten my friend the parrot,
    I've eaten an old woman,&mdash;what's to hinder my eating a
    miserable man and a donkey?"</p>

    <p>And slip! slop! gobble! down went the old man and the
    donkey.</p>

    <p>Then the cat walked on down the road, jauntily, like this.
    After a little, he met a procession, coming that way. The king
    was at the head, walking proudly with his newly married bride,
    and behind him were his soldiers, marching, and behind them
    were ever and ever so many elephants, walking two by two. The
    king felt very kind to everybody, because he had just been
    married, and he said to the cat, "Get out of my way, pussy, get
    out of my way,&mdash;my elephants might hurt you."</p>

    <p>"Hurt me!" said the cat, shaking his fat sides. "Ho, ho!
    I've eaten five hundred cakes, I've eaten my friend the parrot,
    I've eaten an old woman, I've eaten a man and a donkey; what's
    to hinder my eating a beggarly king?"</p>

    <p>And slip! slop! gobble! down went the king; down went the
    queen; down went the soldiers,&mdash;and down went all the
    elephants!</p>

    <p>Then the cat went on, more slowly; he had really had enough
    to eat, now. But a little <a name="Page_171"
       id="Page_171"></a>farther on he met two land-crabs,
       scuttling along in the dust. "Get out of our way, pussy,"
       they squeaked.</p>

    <p>"Ho, ho ho!" cried the cat in a terrible voice. "I've eaten
    five hundred cakes, I've eaten my friend the parrot, I've eaten
    an old woman, a man with a donkey, a king, a queen, his
    men-at-arms, and all his elephants; and now I'll eat you
    too."</p>

    <p>And slip! slop! gobble! down went the two land-crabs.</p>

    <p>When the land-crabs got down inside, they began to look
    around. It was very dark, but they could see the poor king
    sitting in a corner with his bride on his arm; she had fainted.
    Near them were the men-at-arms, treading on one another's toes,
    and the elephants, still trying to form in twos,&mdash;but they
    couldn't, because there was not room. In the opposite corner
    sat the old woman, and near her stood the man and his donkey.
    But in the other corner was a great pile of cakes, and by them
    perched the parrot, his feathers all drooping.</p>

    <p>"Let's get to work!" said the land-crabs. And, snip, snap,
    they began to make a little hole in the side, with their sharp
    claws. Snip, snap, snip, snap,&mdash;till it was big enough to
    get through. Then out they scuttled.</p>

    <p>Then out walked the king, carrying his bride; out marched
    the men-at-arms; out tramped the <a name="Page_172"
       id="Page_172"></a>elephants, two by two; out came the old
       man, beating his donkey; out walked the old woman, scolding
       the cat; and last of all, out hopped the parrot, holding a
       cake in each claw. (You remember, two cakes were all he
       wanted?)</p>

    <p>But the poor cat had to spend the whole day sewing up the
    hole in his coat!</p>

    <p>Once upon a time, there was a Rat Princess, who lived with
    her father, the Rat King, and her mother, the Rat Queen, in a
    ricefield in far away Japan. The Rat Princess was so pretty
    that her father and mother were quite foolishly proud of her,
    and thought no one good enough to play with her. When she grew
    up, they would not let any of the rat princes come to visit
    her, and they decided at last that no one should marry her till
    they had found the most powerful person in the whole world; no
    one else was good enough. And the Father Rat started out to
    find the most powerful person in the whole world. The wisest
    and oldest rat in the ricefield said that the Sun must be the
    most powerful person, because he made the rice grow and ripen;
    so the Rat King went to find <a name="Page_173"
       id="Page_173"></a>the Sun. He climbed up the highest
       mountain, ran up the path of a rainbow, and travelled and
       travelled across the sky till he came to the Sun's
       house.</p>

    <p>"What do you want, little brother?" the Sun said, when he
    saw him.</p>

    <p>"I come," said the Rat King, very importantly, "to offer you
    the hand of my daughter, the princess, because you are the most
    powerful person in the world; no one else is good enough."</p>

    <p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the jolly round Sun, and winked with his
    eye. "You are very kind, little brother, but if that is the
    case the princess is not for me; the Cloud is more powerful
    than I am; when he passes over me I cannot shine."</p>

    <p>"Oh, indeed," said the Rat King, "then you are not my man at
    all"; and he left the Sun without more words. The Sun laughed
    and winked to himself. And the Rat King travelled and travelled
    across the sky till he came to the Cloud's house.</p>

    <p>"What do you want, little brother?" sighed the Cloud when he
    saw him.</p>

    <p>"I come to offer you the hand of my daughter, the princess,"
    said the Rat King, "because you are the most powerful person in
    the world; the Sun said so, and no one else is good
    enough."</p>

    <p>The Cloud sighed again. "I am not the <a name="Page_174"
       id="Page_174"></a>most powerful person," he said; "the Wind
       is stronger than I,&mdash;when he blows, I have to go
       wherever he sends me."</p>

    <p>"Then you are not the person for my daughter," said the Rat
    King proudly; and he started at once to find the Wind. He
    travelled and travelled across the sky, till he came at last to
    the Wind's house, at the very edge of the world.</p>

    <p>When the Wind saw him coming he laughed a big, gusty laugh,
    "Ho, ho!" and asked him what he wanted; and when the Rat King
    told him that he had come to offer him the Rat Princess's hand
    because he was the most powerful person in the world, the Wind
    shouted a great gusty shout, and said, "No, no, I am not the
    strongest; the Wall that man has made is stronger than I; I
    cannot make him move, with all my blowing; go to the Wall,
    little brother!"</p>

    <p>And the Rat King climbed down the sky-path again, and
    travelled and travelled across the earth till he came to the
    Wall. It was quite near his own ricefield.</p>

    <p>"What do you want, little brother?" grumbled the Wall when
    he saw him.</p>

    <p>"I come to offer you the hand of the princess, my daughter,
    because you are the most powerful person in the world, and no
    one else is good enough."</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_175"
       id="Page_175"></a>Ugh, ugh," grumbled the Wall, "I am not
       the strongest; the big grey Rat who lives in the cellar is
       stronger than I. When he gnaws and gnaws at me I crumble and
       crumble, and at last I fall; go to the Rat, little
       brother."</p>

    <p>And so, after going all over the world to find the strongest
    person, the Rat King had to marry his daughter to a rat, after
    all; but the princess was very glad of it, for she wanted to
    marry the grey Rat, all the time.</p>

    <p>This is the Indian story of how fire was brought to the
    tribes. It was long, long ago, when men and beasts talked
    together with understanding, and the grey Coyote was friend and
    counsellor of man.</p>

    <p>There was a Boy of the tribe who was swift of foot and keen
    of eye, and he and the Coyote ranged the wood together. They
    saw the men catching fish in the creeks with their hands, and
    the women digging roots with sharp stones. This was in summer.
    But when winter came on, they saw the people running naked in
    the snow, or huddled in caves of the rocks, and most miserable.
    The Boy noticed this, and was very unhappy for the misery of
    his people.</p>

    <p>"I do not feel it," said the Coyote.</p>

    <p>"You have a coat of good fur," said the Boy, "and my people
    have not."</p>

    <p>"Come to the hunt," said the Coyote.</p>

    <p>"I will hunt no more, till I have found a way to help my
    people against the cold," said the Boy. "Help me, O
    Counsellor!"</p>

    <p><a name="Page_177"
       id="Page_177"></a>Then the Coyote ran away, and came back
       after a long time; he said he had found a way, but it was a
       hard way.</p>

    <p>"No way is too hard," said the Boy. So the Coyote told him
    that they must go to the Burning Mountain and bring fire to the
    people.</p>

    <p>"What is fire?" said the Boy. And the Coyote told him that
    fire was red like a flower, yet not a flower; swift to run in
    the grass and to destroy, like a beast, yet no beast; fierce
    and hurtful, yet a good servant to keep one warm, if kept among
    stones and fed with small sticks.</p>

    <p>"We will get this fire," said the Boy.</p>

    <p>First the Boy had to persuade the people to give him one
    hundred swift runners. Then he and they and the Coyote started
    at a good pace for the far away Burning Mountain. At the end of
    the first day's trail they left the weakest of the runners, to
    wait; at the end of the second, the next stronger; at the end
    of the third, the next; and so for each of the hundred days of
    the journey; and the Boy was the strongest runner, and went to
    the last trail with the Counsellor. High mountains they
    crossed, and great plains, and giant woods, and at last they
    came to the Big Water, quaking along the sand at the foot of
    the Burning Mountain.</p>

    <p>It stood up in a high peaked cone, and smoke rolled out from
    it endlessly along the sky. At <a name="Page_178"
       id="Page_178"></a>night, the Fire Spirits danced, and the
       glare reddened the Big Water far out.</p>

    <p>There the Counsellor said to the Boy, "Stay thou here till I
    bring thee a brand from the burning; be ready and right for
    running, for I shall be far spent when I come again, and the
    Fire Spirits will pursue me."</p>

    <p>Then he went up to the mountain; and the Fire Spirits only
    laughed when they saw him, for he looked so slinking,
    inconsiderable, and mean, that none of them thought harm from
    him. And in the night, when they were at their dance about the
    mountain, the Coyote stole the fire, and ran with it down the
    slope of the burning mountain. When the Fire Spirits saw what
    he had done they streamed out after him, red and angry, with a
    humming sound like a swarm of bees. But the Coyote was still
    ahead; the sparks of the brand streamed out along his flanks,
    as he carried it in his mouth; and he stretched his body to the
    trail.</p>

    <p>The Boy saw him coming, like a falling star against the
    mountain; he heard the singing sound of the Fire Spirits close
    behind, and the labouring breath of the Counsellor. And when
    the good beast panted down beside him, the Boy caught the brand
    from his jaws and was off, like an arrow from a bent bow. Out
    he shot on the homeward path, and the Fire Spirits snapped and
    sang behind him. But fast as they pursued <a name="Page_179"
       id="Page_179"></a>he fled faster, till he saw the next
       runner standing in his place, his body bent for the running.
       To him he passed it, and it was off and away, with the Fire
       Spirits raging in chase.</p>

    <p>So it passed from hand to hand, and the Fire Spirits tore
    after it through the scrub, till they came to the mountains of
    the snows; these they could not pass. Then the dark, sleek
    runners with the backward streaming brand bore it forward,
    shining starlike in the night, glowing red in sultry noons,
    violet pale in twilight glooms, until they came in safety to
    their own land.</p>

    <p>And there they kept it among stones and fed it with small
    sticks, as the Counsellor advised; and it kept the people
    warm.</p>

    <p>Ever after the Boy was called the Fire-Bringer; and ever
    after the Coyote bore the sign of the bringing, for the fur
    along his flanks was singed and yellow from the flames that
    streamed backward from the brand.</p>

    <p>Once there was a good old man who lived up on a mountain,
    far away in Japan. All round his little house the mountain was
    flat, and the ground was rich; and there were the ricefields of
    all the people who lived in the village at the
    <a name="Page_180"
       id="Page_180"></a>mountain's foot. Mornings and evenings,
       the old man and his little grandson, who lived with him,
       used to look far down on the people at work in the village,
       and watch the blue sea which lay all round the land, so
       close that there was no room for fields below, only for
       houses. The little boy loved the ricefields, dearly, for he
       knew that all the good food for all the people came from
       them; and he often helped his grand father to watch over
       them.</p>

    <p>One day, the grandfather was standing alone, before his
    house, looking far down at the people, and out at the sea,
    when, suddenly, he saw something very strange far off where the
    sea and sky meet. Something like a great cloud was rising
    there, as if the sea were lifting itself high into the sky. The
    old man put his hands to his eyes and looked again, hard as his
    old sight could. Then he turned and ran to the house. "Yone,
    Yone!" he cried, "bring a brand from the hearth!"</p>

    <p>The little grandson could not imagine what his grandfather
    wanted with fire, but he always obeyed, so he ran quickly and
    brought the brand. The old man already had one, and was running
    for the ricefields. Yone ran after. But what was his horror to
    see his grandfather thrust his burning brand into the ripe dry
    rice, where it stood.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Grandfather, Grandfather!" screamed the little boy,
    "what are you doing?"</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_181"
       id="Page_181"></a>Quick, set fire! thrust your brand in!"
       said the grandfather.</p>

    <p>Yone thought his dear grandfather had lost his mind, and he
    began to sob; but a little Japanese boy always obeys, so though
    he sobbed, he thrust his torch in, and the sharp flame ran up
    the dry stalks, red and yellow. In an instant, the field was
    ablaze, and thick black smoke began to pour up, on the mountain
    side. It rose like a cloud, black and fierce, and in no time
    the people below saw that their precious ricefields were on
    fire. Ah, how they ran! Men, women, and children climbed the
    mountain, running as fast as they could to save the rice; not
    one soul stayed behind.</p>

    <p>And when they came to the mountain top, and saw the
    beautiful rice-crop all in flames, beyond help, they cried
    bitterly, "Who has done this thing? How did it happen?"</p>

    <p>"I set fire," said the old man, very solemnly; and the
    little grandson sobbed, "Grandfather set fire."</p>

    <p>But when they came fiercely round the old man, with "Why?
    Why?" he only turned and pointed to the sea. "Look!" he
    said.</p>

    <p>They all turned and looked. And there, where the blue sea
    had lain, so calm, a mighty wall of water, reaching from earth
    to sky, was rolling in. No one could scream, so terrible was
    the sight. The wall of water rolled in on <a name="Page_182"
       id="Page_182"></a>the land, passed quite over the place
       where the village had been, and broke, with an awful sound,
       on the mountain side. One wave more, and still one more,
       came; and then all was water, as far as they could look,
       below; the village where they had been was under the
       sea.</p>

    <p>But the people were all safe. And when they saw what the old
    man had done, they honoured him above all men for the quick wit
    which had saved them all from the tidal wave.</p>

    <p>This is a story about a dog,&mdash;not the kind of dog you
    often see in the street here; not a fat, wrinkly pugdog, nor a
    smooth-skinned bulldog, nor even a big shaggy fellow, but a
    slim, silky-haired, sharp-eared little dog, the prettiest thing
    you can imagine. Her name was Wylie, and she lived in Scotland,
    far up on the hills, and helped her master take care of his
    sheep.</p>

    <p>You can't think how clever she was! She watched over the
    sheep and the little lambs like a soldier, and never let
    anything hurt them. She drove them out to pasture when it was
    time, and brought them safely home when it was time for that.
    When the silly sheep got frightened and ran this way and that,
    hurting themselves and getting lost, Wylie knew exactly what to
    <a name="Page_183"
       id="Page_183"></a>do,&mdash;round on one side she would run,
       barking and scolding, driving them back; then round on the
       other, barking and scolding, driving them back, till they
       were all bunched together in front of the right gate. Then
       she drove them through as neatly as any person. She loved
       her work, and was a wonderfully fine sheepdog.</p>

    <p>At last her master grew too old to stay alone on the hills,
    and so he went away to live. Before he went, he gave Wylie to
    two kind young men who lived in the nearest town; he knew they
    would be good to her. They grew very fond of her, and so did
    their old grandmother and the little children: she was so
    gentle and handsome and well behaved.</p>

    <p>So now Wylie lived in the city where there were no sheep
    farms, only streets and houses, and she did not have to do any
    work at all,&mdash;she was just a pet dog. She seemed very
    happy and she was always good.</p>

    <p>But after a while, the family noticed something odd,
    something very strange indeed, about their pet. Every single
    Tuesday night, about nine o'clock, Wylie <i>disappeared</i>.
    They would look for her, call her,&mdash;no, she was gone. And
    she would be gone all night. But every Wednesday morning, there
    she was at the door, waiting to be let in. Her silky coat was
    all sweaty and muddy and her feet heavy with weariness, but her
    bright eyes looked up at her masters as <a name="Page_184"
       id="Page_184"></a>if she were trying to explain where she
       had been.</p>

    <p>Week after week the same thing happened. Nobody could
    imagine where Wylie went every Tuesday night. They tried to
    follow her to find out, but she always slipped away; they tried
    to shut her in, but she always found a way out. It grew to be a
    real mystery. Where in the world did Wylie go?</p>

    <p>You never could guess, so I am going to tell you.</p>

    <p>In the city near the town where the kind young men lived was
    a big market like (naming one in the neighbourhood). Every sort
    of thing was sold there, even live cows and sheep and hens. On
    Tuesday nights, the farmers used to come down from the hills
    with their sheep to sell, and drive them through the city
    streets into the pens, ready to sell on Wednesday morning; that
    was the day they sold them.</p>

    <p>The sheep weren't used to the city noises and sights, and
    they always grew afraid and wild, and gave the farmers and the
    sheepdogs a great deal of trouble. They broke away and ran
    about, in everybody's way.</p>

    <p>But just as the trouble was worst, about sunrise, the
    farmers would see a little silky, sharp-eared dog come trotting
    all alone down the road, into the midst of them.</p>

    <p>And then!</p>

    <p><a name="Page_185"
       id="Page_185"></a>In and out the little dog ran like the
       wind, round and about, always in the right place,
       driving&mdash;coaxing&mdash;pushing&mdash;making the sheep
       mind like a good school-teacher, and never frightening them,
       till they were all safely in! All the other dogs together
       could not do as much as the little strange dog. She was a
       perfect wonder. And no one knew whose dog she was or where
       she came from. The farmers grew to watch for her, every
       week, and they called her "the wee fell yin" which is Scots
       for "the little terror"; they used to say when they saw her
       coming, "There's the wee fell yin! Now we'll get them
       in."</p>

    <p>Every farmer would have liked to keep her, but she let no
    one catch her. As soon as her work was done she was off and
    away like a fairy dog, no one knew where. Week after week this
    happened, and nobody knew who the little strange dog was.</p>

    <p>But one day Wylie went to walk with her two masters, and
    they happened to meet some sheep farmers. The sheep farmers
    stopped short and stared at Wylie, and then they cried out,
    "Why, <i>that's the dog</i>! That's the wee fell yin!" And so
    it was. The little strange dog who helped with the sheep was
    Wylie.</p>

    <p>Her masters, of course, didn't know what the farmers meant,
    till they were told all about what I have been telling you. But
    when they heard <a name="Page_186"
       id="Page_186"></a>about the pretty strange dog who came to
       market all alone, they knew at last where Wylie went, every
       Tuesday night. And they loved her better than ever.</p>

    <p>Wasn't it wise of the dear little dog to go and work for
    other people when her own work was taken away? I fancy she knew
    that the best people and the best dogs always work hard at
    something. Any way she did that same thing as long as she
    lived, and she was always just as gentle, and silky-haired, and
    loving as at first.</p>

    <p>Once there was a beautiful palace, which had a great wood at
    one side. The king and his courtiers hunted in the wood near
    the palace, and there it was kept open, free from underbrush.
    But farther away it grew wilder and wilder, till at last it was
    so thick that nobody knew what was there. It was a very great
    wood indeed.</p>

    <p>In the wood lived eight fairies. Seven of them were good
    fairies, who had lived there always; the eighth was a bad
    fairy, who had just come. And the worst of it was that nobody
    but the other fairies knew she <i>was</i> a fairy; people
    thought she was just an ugly old witch. The good fairies lived
    in the dearest little houses!<a name="Page_187"
       id="Page_187"></a> One lived in a hollow silver birch, one
       in a little moss cottage, and so on. But the bad fairy lived
       in a horrid mud house in the middle of a dark swamp.</p>

    <p>Now when the first baby was born to the king and queen, her
    father and mother decided to name her "Daylight," because she
    was so bright and sweet. And of course they had a
    christening party. And of <i>course</i> they invited the fairies,
    because the good fairies had always been at the christening
    party when a princess was born in the palace, and everybody
    knew that they brought good gifts.</p>

    <p>But, alas, no one knew about the swamp fairy, and she was
    not invited,&mdash;which really pleased her, because it gave
    her an excuse for doing something mean.</p>

    <p>The good fairies came to the christening party, and, one
    after another, five of them gave little Daylight good gifts.
    The other two stood among the guests, so that no one noticed
    them. The swamp fairy thought there were no more of them; so
    she stepped forward, just as the archbishop was handing the
    baby back to the lady-in-waiting.</p>

    <p>"I am just a little deaf," she said, mumbling a laugh with
    her toothless gums. "Will your reverence tell me the baby's
    name again?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly, my good woman," said the bishop; "the infant is
    little Daylight."</p>

    <p>"And little Daylight it shall be,
    forsooth,"<a name="Page_188"
       id="Page_188"></a> cried the bad fairy. "I decree that she
       shall sleep all day." Then she laughed a horrid shrieking
       laugh, "He, he, hi, hi!"</p>

    <p>Everyone looked at everyone else in despair, but out stepped
    the sixth good fairy, who by arrangement with her sisters had
    remained in the background to undo what she could of any evil
    that the swamp fairy might decree.</p>

    <p>"Then at least she shall wake all night," she said,
    sadly.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" screamed the swamp fairy, "you spoke before I had
    finished, which is against the law, and gives me another
    chance." All the fairies started at once to say, "I beg your
    pardon!" But the bad fairy said, "I had only laughed 'he, he!'
    and 'hi, hi!' I had still 'ho, ho!' and 'hu, hu!' to
    laugh."</p>

    <p>The fairies could not gainsay this, and the bad fairy had
    her other chance. She said,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Since she is to wake all night, I decree that she shall wax
    and wane with the moon! Ho, ho, hu, hu!"</p>

    <p>Out stepped the seventh good fairy. "Until a prince shall
    kiss her without knowing who she is," she said, quickly.</p>

    <p>The swamp fairy had been prepared for the trick of keeping
    back one good fairy, but she had not suspected it of two, and
    she could not say a word, for she had laughed "ho, ho!" and
    "hu, hu!"</p>

    <p><a name="Page_189"
       id="Page_189"></a>The poor king and queen looked sad enough.
       "We don't know what you mean," they said to the good fairy
       who had spoken last. But the good fairy smiled. "The meaning
       of the thing will come with the thing," she said.</p>

    <p>That was the end of the party, but it was only the beginning
    of the trouble. Can you imagine what a queer household it would
    be, where the baby laughed and crowed all night, and slept all
    day? Little Daylight was as merry and bright all night as any
    baby in the world, but with the first sign of dawn she fell
    asleep, and slept like a little dormouse till dark. Nothing
    could waken her while day lasted. Still, the royal family got
    used to this; but the rest of the bad fairy's gift was a great
    deal</p>

    <p>worse,&mdash;that about waxing and waning with the moon. You
    know how the moon grows bigger and brighter each night, from
    the time it is a curly silver thread low in the sky till it is
    round and golden, flooding the whole sky with light? That is
    the waxing moon. Then, you know, it wanes; it grows smaller and
    paler again, night by night, till at last it disappears for a
    while, altogether. Well, poor little Daylight waxed and waned
    with it. She was the rosiest, plumpest, merriest baby in the
    world when the moon was at the full; but as it began to wane
    her little cheeks grew paler, her tiny hands thinner, with
    every night, till <a name="Page_190"
       id="Page_190"></a>she lay in her cradle like a shadow-baby,
       without sound or motion. At first they thought she was dead,
       when the moon disappeared, but after some months they got
       used to this too, and only waited eagerly for the new moon,
       to see her revive. When it shone again, faint and silver, on
       the horizon, the baby stirred weakly, and then they fed her
       gently; each night she grew a little better, and when the
       moon was near the full again, she was again a lively, rosy,
       lovely child.</p>

    <p>So it went on till she grew up. She grew to be the most
    beautiful maiden the moon ever shone on, and everyone loved her
    so much, for her sweet ways and her merry heart, that someone
    was always planning to stay up at night, to be near her. But
    she did not like to be watched, especially when she felt the
    bad time of waning coming on; so her ladies-in-waiting had to
    be very careful. When the moon waned she became shrunken and
    pale and bent, like an old, old woman, worn out with sorrow.
    Only her golden hair and her blue eyes remained unchanged, and
    this gave her a terribly strange look. At last, as the moon
    disappeared, she faded away to a little, bowed, old creature,
    asleep and helpless.</p>

    <p>No wonder she liked best to be alone! She got in the way of
    wandering by herself in the beautiful wood, playing in the
    moonlight when <a name="Page_191"
       id="Page_191"></a>she was well, stealing away in the shadows
       when she was fading with the moon. Her father had a lovely
       little house of roses and vines built for her, there. It
       stood at the edge of a most beautiful open glade, inside the
       wood, where the moon shone best. There the princess lived
       with her ladies. And there she danced when the moon was
       full. But when the moon waned, her ladies often lost her
       altogether, so far did she wander; and sometimes they found
       her sleeping under a great tree, and brought her home in
       their arms.</p>

    <p>When the princess was about seventeen years old, there was a
    rebellion in a kingdom not far from her father's. Wicked nobles
    murdered the king of the country and stole his throne, and
    would have murdered the young prince, too, if he had not
    escaped, dressed in peasant's clothes.</p>

    <p>Dressed in his poor rags, the prince wandered about a long
    time, till one day he got into a great wood, and lost his way.
    It was the wood where the Princess Daylight lived, but of
    course he did not know anything about that nor about her. He
    wandered till night, and then he came to a queer little house.
    One of the good fairies lived there, and the minute she saw him
    she knew all about everything; but to him she looked only like
    a kind old woman. She gave him a good supper and a bed for the
    night, and <a name="Page_192"
       id="Page_192"></a>told him to come back to her if he found
       no better place for the next night. But the prince said he
       must get out of the wood at once; so in the morning he took
       leave of the fairy.</p>

    <p>All day long he walked, and walked; but at nightfall he had
    not found his way out of the wood, so he lay down to rest till
    the moon should rise and light his path.</p>

    <p>When he woke the moon was glorious; it was three days from
    the full, and bright as silver. By its light he saw what he
    thought to be the edge of the wood, and he hastened toward it.
    But when he came to it, it was only an open space, surrounded
    with trees. It was so very lovely, in the white moonlight, that
    the prince stood a minute to look. And as he looked, something
    white moved out of the trees on the far side of the open space.
    It was something slim and white, that swayed in the dim light
    like a young birch.</p>

    <p>"It must be a moon fairy," thought the prince; and he
    stepped into the shadow.</p>

    <p>The moon fairy came nearer and nearer, dancing and swaying
    in the moonlight. And as she came, she began to sing a soft,
    gay little song.</p>

    <p>But when she was quite close, the prince saw that she was
    not a fairy after all, but a real human maiden,&mdash;the
    loveliest maiden he had ever seen. Her hair was like yellow
    corn, and <a name="Page_193"
       id="Page_193"></a>her smile made all the place merry. Her
       white gown fluttered as she danced, and her little song
       sounded like a bird note.</p>

    <p>The prince watched her till she danced out of sight, and
    then until she once more came toward him; and she seemed so
    like a moonbeam herself, as she lifted her face to the sky,
    that he was almost afraid to breathe. He had never seen
    anything so lovely. By the time she had danced twice round the
    circle, he could think of nothing in the world except the hope
    of finding out who she was, and staying near her.</p>

    <p>But while he was waiting for her to appear the third time,
    his weariness overcame him, and he fell asleep. And when he
    awoke, it was broad day, and the beautiful maiden had
    vanished.</p>

    <p>He hunted about, hoping to find where she lived, and on the
    other side of the glade he came upon a lovely little house,
    covered with moss and climbing roses. He thought she must live
    there, so he went round to the kitchen door and asked the kind
    cook for a drink of water, and while he was drinking it he
    asked who lived there. She told him it was the house of the
    Princess Daylight, but she told him nothing else about her,
    because she was not allowed to talk about her mistress. But she
    gave him a very good meal and told him other things.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_194"
       id="Page_194"></a>He did not go back to the little old woman
       who had been so kind to him first, but wandered all day in
       the wood, waiting for the moontime. Again he waited at the
       edge of the dell, and when the white moon was high in the
       heavens, once more he saw the glimmering in the distance,
       and once more the lovely maiden floated toward him. He knew
       her name was the Princess Daylight, but this time she seemed
       to him much lovelier than before. She was all in blue like
       the blue of the sky in summer. (She really was more lovely,
       you know, because the moon was almost at the full.) All
       night he watched her, quite forgetting that he ought not to
       be doing it, till she disappeared on the opposite side of
       the glade. Then, very tired, he found his way to the little
       old woman's house, had breakfast with her, and fell fast
       asleep in the bed she gave him.</p>

    <p>The fairy knew well enough by his face that he had seen
    Daylight, and when he woke up in the evening and started off
    again she gave him a strange little flask and told him to use
    it if ever he needed it.</p>

    <p>This night the princess did not appear in the dell until
    midnight, at the very full of the moon. But when she came, she
    was so lovely that she took the prince's breath away. Just
    think!&mdash;she was dressed in a gown that looked as if it
    were made of fireflies' wings, em<a name="Page_195"
       id="Page_195"></a>broidered in gold. She danced around and
       around, singing, swaying, and flitting like a beam of
       sunlight, till the prince grew quite dazzled.</p>

    <p>But while he had been watching her, he had not noticed that
    the sky was growing dark and the wind was rising. Suddenly
    there was a clap of thunder. The princess danced on. But
    another clap came louder, and then a sudden great flash of
    lightning that lit up the sky from end to end. The prince
    couldn't help shutting his eyes, but he opened them quickly to
    see if Daylight was hurt. Alas, she was lying on the ground.
    The prince ran to her, but she was already up again.</p>

    <p>"Who are you?" she said.</p>

    <p>"I thought," stammered the prince, " you might be hurt."</p>

    <p>"There is nothing the matter. Go away."</p>

    <p>The prince went sadly.</p>

    <p>"Come back," said the princess. The prince came. "I like
    you, you do as you are told. Are you good?"</p>

    <p>"Not so good as I should like to be," said the prince.</p>

    <p>"Then go and grow better," said the princess.</p>

    <p>The prince went, more sadly.</p>

    <p>"Come back," said the princess. The prince came. "I think
    you must be a prince," she said.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_196"
       id="Page_196"></a>Why?" said the prince.</p>

    <p>"Because you do as you are told, and you tell the truth.
    Will you tell me what the sun looks like?"</p>

    <p>"Why, everybody knows that," said the prince.</p>

    <p>"I am different from everybody," said the princess,&mdash;"I
    don't know."</p>

    <p>"But," said the prince, "do you not look when you wake up in
    the morning?"</p>

    <p>"That's just it," said the princess, "I never do wake up in
    the morning. I never can wake up until&mdash;" Then the
    princess remembered that she was talking to a prince, and
    putting her hands over her face she walked swiftly away. The
    prince followed her, but she turned and put up her hand to tell
    him not to. And like the gentleman prince that he was, he
    obeyed her at once.</p>

    <p>Now all this time, the wicked swamp fairy had not known a
    word about what was going on. But now she found out, and she
    was furious, for fear that little Daylight should be delivered
    from her spell. So she cast her spells to keep the prince from
    finding Daylight again. Night after night the poor prince
    wandered and wandered, and never could find the little dell.
    And when daytime came, of course, there was no princess to be
    seen. Finally, at the time that the moon was almost
    <a name="Page_197"
       id="Page_197"></a>gone, the swamp fairy stopped her spells,
       because she knew that by this time Daylight would be so
       changed and ugly that the prince would never know her if he
       did see her. She said to herself with a wicked
       laugh:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"No fear of his wanting to kiss her now!"</p>

    <p>That night the prince did find the dell, but no princess
    came. A little after midnight he passed near the lovely little
    house where she lived, and there he overheard her waiting-women
    talking about her. They seemed in great distress. They were
    saying that the princess had wandered into the woods and was
    lost. The prince didn't know, of course, what it meant, but he
    did understand that the princess was lost somewhere, and he
    started off to find her. After he had gone a long way without
    finding her, he came to a big old tree, and there he thought he
    would light a fire to show her the way if she should happen to
    see it.</p>

    <p>As the blaze flared up, he suddenly saw a little black heap
    on the other side of the tree. Somebody was lying there. He ran
    to the spot, his heart beating with hope. But when he lifted
    the cloak which was huddled about the form, he saw at once that
    it was not Daylight. A pinched, withered, white, little old
    woman's face shone out at him. The hood was drawn close down
    over her forehead, the eyes <a name="Page_198"
       id="Page_198"></a>were closed, and as the prince lifted the
       cloak, the old woman's lips moaned faintly.</p>

    <p>"Oh, poor mother," said the prince, "what is the matter?"
    The old woman only moaned again. The prince lifted her and
    carried her over to the warm fire, and rubbed her hands, trying
    to find out what was the matter. But she only moaned, and her
    face was so terribly strange and white that the prince's tender
    heart ached for her. Remembering his little flask, he poured
    some of his liquid between her lips, and then he thought the
    best thing he could do was to carry her to the princess's
    house, where she could be taken care of.</p>

    <p>As he lifted the poor little form in his arms, two great
    tears stole out from the old woman's closed eyes and ran down
    her wrinkled cheeks.</p>

    <p>"Oh, poor, poor mother," said the prince pityingly; and he
    stooped and kissed her withered lips.</p>

    <p>As he walked through the forest with the old woman in his
    arms, it seemed to him that she grew heavier and heavier; he
    could hardly carry her at all; and then she stirred, and at
    last he was obliged to set her down, to rest. He meant to lay
    her on the ground. But the old woman stood upon her feet.</p>

    <p>And then the hood fell back from her face. As she looked up
    at the prince, the first, long, yellow ray of the rising sun
    struck full upon <a name="Page_199"
       id="Page_199"></a>her,&mdash;and it was the Princess
       Daylight! Her hair was golden as the sun itself, and her
       eyes as blue as the flower that grows in the corn.</p>

    <p>The prince fell on his knees before her. But she gave him
    her hand and made him rise.</p>

    <p>"You kissed me when I was an old woman," said the princess,
    "I'll kiss you now that I am a young princess." And she
    did.</p>

    <p>And then she turned her face toward the dawn.</p>

    <p>"Dear Prince," she said, "is that the sun?"</p>

    <p>Once upon a time, two children came to the house of a sailor
    man, who lived beside the salt sea; and they found the sailor
    man sitting in his doorway knotting ropes.</p>

    <p>"How do you do?" asked the sailor man.</p>

    <p>We are very well, thank you," said the children, who had
    learned manners, "and we hope you are the same. We heard that
    you had a boat, and we thought that perhaps you would take us
    out in her, and teach us how to sail, for that is what we most
    wish to know."</p>

    <p>"All in good time," said the sailor man. "I am busy now, but
    by-and-by, when my work is done, I may perhaps take one of you
    if you <a name="Page_200"
       id="Page_200"></a>are ready to learn. Meantime here are some
       ropes that need knotting; you might be doing that, since it
       has to be done." And he showed them how the knots should be
       tied, and went away and left them.</p>

    <p>When he was gone the first child ran to the window and
    looked out.</p>

    <p>"There is the sea," he said. "The waves come up on the
    beach, almost to the door of the house. They run up all white,
    like prancing horses, and then they go dragging back. Come and
    look!"</p>

    <p>"I cannot," said the second child. "I am tying a knot."</p>

    <p>"Oh!" cried the first child, "I see the boat. She is dancing
    like a lady at a ball; I never saw such a beauty. Come and
    look!"</p>

    <p>"I cannot," said the second child. "I am tying a knot."</p>

    <p>"I shall have a delightful sail in that boat," said the
    first child. "I expect that the sailor man will take me,
    because I am the eldest and I know more about it. There was no
    need of my watching when he showed you the knots, because I
    knew how already."</p>

    <p>Just then the sailor man came in.</p>

    <p>"Well," he said, "my work is over. What have you been doing
    in the meantime?"</p>

    <p>"I have been looking at the boat," said the first child.
    "What a beauty she is! I shall <a name="Page_201"
       id="Page_201"></a>have the best time in her that ever I had
       in my life."</p>

    <p>"I have been tying knots," said the second child.</p>

    <p>"Come, then," said the sailor man, and he held out his hand
    to the second child. "I will take you out in the boat, and
    teach you to sail her."</p>

    <p>"But I am the eldest," cried the first child, "and I know a
    great deal more than she does."</p>

    <p>"That may be," said the sailor man; "but a person must learn
    to tie a knot before he can learn to sail a boat."</p>

    <p>"But I have learned to tie a knot," cried the child. "I know
    all about it!"</p>

    <p>"How can I tell that?" asked the sailor man.</p>

    <p>Once, while Jesus was journeying about, He passed near a
    town where a man named Jairus lived. This man was a ruler in
    the synagogue, and he had just one little daughter about twelve
    years of age. At the time that Jesus was there
    <a name="Page_202"
       id="Page_202"></a>the little daughter was very sick, and at
       last she lay a-dying.</p>

    <p>Her father heard that there was a wonderful man near the
    town, who was healing sick people whom no one else could help,
    and in his despair he ran out into the streets to search for
    Him. He found Jesus walking in the midst of a crowd of people,
    and when he saw Him he fell down at Jesus feet and besought Him
    to come into his house, to heal his daughter. And Jesus said,
    Yes, he would go with him. But there were so many people
    begging to be healed, and so many looking to see what happened,
    that the crowd thronged them, and kept them from moving fast.
    And before they reached the house one of the man's servants
    came to meet them, and said, "Thy daughter is dead; trouble not
    the Master to come farther."</p>

    <p>But instantly Jesus turned to the father and said, "Fear
    not; only believe, and she shall be made whole." And He went on
    with Jairus, to the house.</p>

    <p>When they came to the house, they heard the sound of weeping
    and lamentation; the household was mourning for the little
    daughter, who was dead. Jesus sent all the strangers away from
    the door, and only three of His disciples and the father and
    mother of the child went in with Him. And when He was within,
    He said <a name="Page_203"
       id="Page_203"></a>to the mourning people, "Weep not; she is
       not dead; she sleepeth."</p>

    <p>When He had passed, they laughed Him to scorn, for they knew
    that she was dead.</p>

    <p>Then Jesus left them all, and went alone into the chamber
    where the little daughter lay. And when He was there, alone, He
    went up to the bed where she was, and bent over her, and took
    her by the hand. And He said, "Maiden, arise."</p>

    <p>And her spirit came unto her again! And she lived, and grew
    up in her father's house.</p>

    <p>Once there was a great king in Britain named Uther, and when
    he died the other kings and princes disputed over the kingdom,
    each wanting it for himself. But King Uther had a son named
    Arthur, the rightful heir to the throne, of whom no one knew,
    for he had been taken away secretly while he was still a baby
    by a wise old man called Merlin, who had him brought up in the
    family of a certain Sir Ector, for fear of the malice of wicked
    knights. Even the boy himself thought Sir Ector was his father,
    and he loved Sir Ector's son, Sir Kay, with the love of a
    brother.</p>

    <p>When the kings and princes could not be kept in check any
    longer, and something had to be done to determine who was to be
    king, Merlin made the Archbishop of Canterbury send for them
    all to come to London. It was Christmas time, and in the great
    cathedral a solemn service was held, and prayer was made that
    some sign should be given, to show who was the rightful king.
    When the service was <a name="Page_205"
       id="Page_205"></a>over, there appeared a strange stone in
       the churchyard, against the high altar. It was a great white
       stone, like marble, with something sunk in it that looked
       like a steel anvil; and in the anvil was driven a great
       glistening sword. The sword had letters of gold written on
       it, which read: "Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone
       and anvil is rightwise king born of all England."</p>

    <p>All wondered at the strange sword and its strange writing;
    and when the archbishop himself came out and gave permission,
    many of the knights tried to pull the sword from the stone,
    hoping to be king. But no one could move it a hair's
    breadth.</p>

    <p>"He is not here," said the archbishop, "that shall achieve
    the sword; but doubt not, God will make him known."</p>

    <p>Then they set a guard of ten knights to keep the stone, and
    the archbishop appointed a day when all should come together to
    try at the stone,&mdash;kings from far and near. In the
    meantime, splendid jousts were held, outside London, and both
    knights and commons were bidden.</p>

    <p>Sir Ector came up to the jousts, with others, and with him
    rode Kay and Arthur. Kay had been made a knight at
    Allhallowmas, and when he found there was to be so fine a joust
    he wanted a sword, to join it. But he had left his sword
    behind, where his father and he had <a name="Page_206"
       id="Page_206"></a>slept the night before. So he asked young
       Arthur to ride for it.</p>

    <p>"I will well," said Arthur, and rode back for it. But when
    he came to the castle, the lady and all her household were at
    the jousting, and there was none to let him in.</p>

    <p>Thereat Arthur said to himself, "My brother Sir Kay shall
    not be without a sword this day." And he remembered the sword
    he had seen in the churchyard. "I will to the churchyard," he
    said, "and take that sword with me." So he rode into the
    churchyard, tied his horse to the stile, and went up to the
    stone. The guards were away to the tourney, and the sword was
    there, alone.</p>

    <p>Going up to the stone, young Arthur took the great sword by
    the hilt, and lightly and fiercely he drew it out of the
    anvil.</p>

    <p>Then he rode straight to Sir Kay, and gave it to him.</p>

    <p>Sir Kay knew instantly that it was the sword of the stone,
    and he rode off at once to his father and said, "Sir, lo, here
    is the sword of the stone; I must be king of the land." But Sir
    Ector asked him where he got the sword. And when Sir Kay said,
    "From my brother," he asked Arthur how he got it. When Arthur
    told him, Sir Ector bowed his head before him. "Now I
    understand ye must be king of this land," he said to
    Arthur.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_207"
       id="Page_207"></a>Wherefore I?" said Arthur.</p>

    <p>"For God will have it so," said Ector; "never man should
    have drawn out this sword but he that shall be rightwise king
    of this land. Now let me see whether ye can put the sword as it
    was in the stone, and pull it out again."</p>

    <p>Straightway Arthur put the sword back.</p>

    <p>Then Sir Ector tried to pull it out, and after him Sir Kay;
    but neither could stir it. Then Arthur pulled it out.
    Thereupon, Sir Ector and Sir Kay kneeled upon the ground before
    him.</p>

    <p>"Alas," said Arthur, "mine own dear father and brother, why
    kneel ye to me?"</p>

    <p>Sir Ector told him, then, all about his royal birth, and how
    he had been taken privily away by Merlin. But when Arthur found
    Sir Ector was not truly his father, he was so sad at heart that
    he cared not greatly to be king. And he begged his father and
    brother to love him still. Sir Ector asked that Sir Kay might
    be seneschal when Arthur was king. Arthur promised with all his
    heart.</p>

    <p>Then they went to the archbishop and told him that the sword
    had found its master. The archbishop appointed a day for the
    trial to be made in the sight of all men, and on that day the
    princes and knights came together, and each tried to draw out
    the sword, as before. But as before, none could so much as stir
    it.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_208"
       id="Page_208"></a>Then came Arthur, and pulled it easily
       from its place.</p>

    <p>The knights and kings were terribly angry that a boy from
    nowhere in particular had beaten them, and they refused to
    acknowledge him king. They appointed another day, for another
    great trial.</p>

    <p>Three times they did this, and every time the same thing
    happened.</p>

    <p>At last, at the feast of Pentecost, Arthur again pulled out
    the sword before all the knights and the commons. And then the
    commons rose up and cried that he should be king, and that they
    would slay any who denied him.</p>

    <p>So Arthur became king of Britain, and all gave him
    allegiance.</p>

    <p>There was once a girl named Tarpeia, whose father was guard
    of the outer gate of the citadel of Rome. It was a time of
    war,&mdash;the Sabines were besieging the city. Their camp was
    close outside the city wall.</p>

    <p>Tarpeia used to see the Sabine soldiers when she went to
    draw water from the public well, for that was outside the gate.
    And sometimes she stayed about and let the strange men talk
    with her, because she liked to look at their bright silver
    ornaments. The Sabine soldiers <a name="Page_209"
       id="Page_209"></a>wore heavy silver rings and bracelets on
       their left arms,&mdash;some wore as many as four or
       five.</p>

    <p>The soldiers knew she was the daughter of the keeper of the
    citadel, and they saw that she had greedy eyes for their
    ornaments. So day by day they talked with her, and showed her
    their silver rings, and tempted her. And at last Tarpeia made a
    bargain, to betray her city to them. She said she would unlock
    the great gate and let them in, <i>if they would give her what
    they wore on their left arms.</i></p>

    <p>The night came. When it was perfectly dark and still,
    Tarpeia stole from her bed, took the great key from its place,
    and silently unlocked the gate which protected the city.
    Outside, in the dark, stood the soldiers of the enemy, waiting.
    As she opened the gate, the long shadowy files pressed forward
    silently, and the Sabines entered the citadel.</p>

    <p>As the first man came inside, Tarpeia stretched forth her
    hand for her price. The soldier lifted high his left arm. "Take
    thy reward!" he said, and as he spoke he hurled upon her that
    which he wore upon it. Down upon her head crashed&mdash;not the
    silver rings of the soldier, but the great brass shield he
    carried in battle!</p>

    <p>She sank beneath it, to the ground.</p>

    <p>"Take thy reward," said the next; and his shield rang
    against the first.</p>

    <p>"Thy reward," said the next&mdash;and the
    next&mdash;<a name="Page_210"
       id="Page_210"></a> and the next&mdash;and the next; every
       man wore his shield on his left arm.</p>

    <p>So Tarpeia lay buried beneath the reward she had claimed,
    and the Sabines marched past her dead body, into the city she
    had betrayed.</p>

    <p>Down by the river were fields of barley and rye and golden
    oats. Wheat grew there, too, and the heaviest and richest ears
    bent lowest, in humility. Opposite the corn was a field of
    buckwheat, but the buckwheat never bent; it held its head proud
    and stiff on the stem.</p>

    <p>The wise old willow-tree by the river looked down on the

    <p>One day a dreadful storm came. The field-flowers folded

    "the angel of the storm is coming; he will strike you
    down."</p>

    <p>"I will not bend my head," said the buckwheat.</p>

    <p>Then the old willow-tree spoke: "Close your
    <a name="Page_211"
       id="Page_211"></a>flowers and bend your leaves. Do not look
       at the lightning when the cloud bursts. Even men cannot do
       that; the sight of heaven would strike them blind. Much less
       can we who are so inferior to them!"</p>

    <p>"'Inferior,' indeed!" said the buckwheat. "Now I <i>will</i>
    look!" And he looked straight up, while the lightning flashed
    across the sky.</p>

    <p>When the dreadful storm had passed, the flowers and the
    wheat raised their drooping heads, clean and refreshed in the
    pure, sweet air. The willow-tree shook the gentle drops from
    its leaves.</p>

    <p>But the buckwheat lay like a weed in the field, scorched
    black by the lightning.</p>

    <p>The Greek God Pan, the god of the open air, was a great
    musician. He played on a pipe of reeds. And the sound of his
    reed-pipe was so sweet that he grew proud, and believed himself
    greater than the chief musician of the gods, Apollo, the
    sun-god. So he challenged great Apollo to make better music
    than he.</p>

    <p>Apollo consented to the test, for he wished to punish Pan's
    vanity, and they chose the mountain Tmolus for judge, since no
    one is so old and wise as the hills.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_212"
       id="Page_212"></a>When Pan and Apollo came before Tmolus, to
       play, their followers came with them, to hear, and one of
       those who came with Pan was a mortal named Midas.</p>

    <p>First Pan played; he blew on his reed-pipe, and out came a
    tune so wild and yet so coaxing that the birds hopped from the
    trees to get near; the squirrels came running from their holes;
    and the very trees swayed as if they wanted to dance. The fauns
    laughed aloud for joy as the melody tickled their furry little
    ears. And Midas thought it the sweetest music in the world.</p>

    <p>Then Apollo rose. His hair shook drops of light from its
    curls; his robes were like the edge of the sunset cloud; in his
    hands he held a golden lyre. And when he touched the strings of
    the lyre, such music stole upon the air as never god nor mortal
    heard before. The wild creatures of the wood crouched still as
    stone; the trees kept every leaf from rustling; earth and air
    were silent as a dream. To hear such music cease was like
    bidding farewell to father and mother.</p>

    <p>When the charm was broken, the hearers fell at Apollo's feet
    and proclaimed the victory his. All but Midas. He alone would
    not admit that the music was better than Pan's.</p>

    <p>"If thine ears are so dull, mortal," said Apollo, "they
    shall take the shape that suits <a name="Page_213"
       id="Page_213"></a>them." And he touched the ears of Midas.
       And straightway the dull ears grew long, pointed, and furry,
       and they turned this way and that. They were the ears of an
       ass!</p>

    <p>For a long time Midas managed to hide the tell-tale ears
    from everyone; but at last a servant discovered the secret. He
    knew he must not tell, yet he could not bear not to; so one day
    he went into the meadow, scooped a little hollow in the turf,
    and whispered the secret into the earth. Then he covered it up
    again, and went away. But, alas, a bed of reeds sprang up from
    the spot, and whispered the secret to the grass. The grass told
    it to the tree-tops, the tree-tops to the little birds, and
    they cried it all abroad.</p>

    <p>And to this day, when the wind sets the reeds nodding
    together, they whisper, laugh- ing, "Midas has the ears of an
    ass! Oh, hush, hush!"</p>

    <p>Once there were two brothers. One was rich, and one was
    poor; the rich one was <a name="Page_214"
       id="Page_214"></a>rather mean. When the Poor Brother used to
       come to ask for things it annoyed him, and finally one day
       he said, "There, I'll give it to you this time, but the next
       time you want anything, you can go Below for it!"</p>

    <p>Presently the Poor Brother did want something, and he knew
    it wasn't any use to go to his brother; he must go Below for
    it. So he went, and he went, and he went, till he came
    Below.</p>

    <p>It was the queerest place! There were red and yellow fires
    burning all around, and kettles of boiling oil hanging over
    them, and a queer sort of men standing round, poking the fires.
    There was a Chief Man; he had a long curly tail that curled up
    behind, and two ugly little horns just over his ears; and one
    foot was very queer indeed. And as soon as anyone came in the
    door, these men would catch him up and put him over one of the
    fires, and turn him on a spit. And then the Chief Man, who was
    the worst of all, would come and say, "Eh, how do you feel now?
    How do you feel now?" And of course the poor people screamed
    and screeched and said, "Let us out! Let us out!" That was just
    what the Chief Man wanted.</p>

    <p>When the Poor Brother came in, they picked him up at once,
    and put him over one of the hottest fires, and began to turn
    him round and <a name="Page_215"
       id="Page_215"></a>round like the rest; and of course the
       Chief Man came up to him and said, "Eh, how do you feel now?
       How do you feel now?" But the Poor Brother did not say, "Let
       me out! Let me out!" He said, "Pretty well, thank you."</p>

    <p>The Chief Man grunted and said to the other men, "Make the
    fire hotter." But the next time he asked the Poor Brother how
    he felt, the Poor Brother smiled and said, "Much better now,
    thank you." The Chief Man did not like this at all, because, of
    course, the whole object in life of the people Below was to
    make their victims uncomfortable. So he piled on more fuel and
    made the fire hotter still. But every time he asked the Poor
    Brother how he felt, the Poor Brother would say, "Very much
    better"; and at last he said, " Perfectly com- fortable, thank
    you; couldn't be better."</p>

    <p>You see when the Poor Brother was on earth he had never once
    had money enough to buy coal enough to keep him warm; so he
    liked the heat.</p>

    <p>At last the Chief Man could stand it no longer.</p>

    <p>"Oh, look here," he said, "you can go home."</p>

    <p>"Oh no, thank you," said the Poor Brother, "I like it
    here."</p>

    <p>"You <i>must</i> go home," said the Chief Man.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_216"
       id="Page_216"></a>But I won't go home," said the Poor
       Brother.</p>

    <p>The Chief Man went away and talked with the other men; but
    no matter what they did they could not make the Poor Brother
    uncomfortable; so at last the Chief Man came back and
    said,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"What'll you take to go home?"</p>

    <p>"What have you got?" said the Poor Brother.</p>

    <p>"Well," said the Chief Man, "if you'll go home quietly I'll
    give you the Little Mill that stands behind my door."</p>

    <p>"What's the good of it?" said the Poor Brother.</p>

    <p>"It is the most wonderful mill in the world," said the Chief
    Man. "Anything at all that you want, you have only to name it,
    and say, 'Grind this, Little Mill, and grind quickly,' and the
    Mill will grind that thing until you say the magic word, to
    stop it."</p>

    <p>"That sounds nice," said the Poor Brother. "I'll take it."
    And he took the Little Mill under his arm, and went up, and up,
    and up, till he came to his own house.</p>

    <p>When he was in front of his little old hut, he put the
    Little Mill down on the ground and said to it, "Grind a fine
    house, Little Mill, and grind quickly." And the Little Mill
    ground, and ground, and ground the finest house that
    <a name="Page_217"
       id="Page_217"></a>ever was seen. It had fine big chimneys,
       and gable windows, and broad piazzas; and just as the Little
       Mill ground the last step of the last flight of steps, the
       Poor Brother said the magic word, and it stopped.</p>

    <p>Then he took it round to where the barn was, and said,
    "Grind cattle, Little Mill, and grind quickly." And the Little
    Mill ground, and ground, and ground, and out came great fat
    cows, and little woolly lambs, and fine little pigs; and just
    as the Little Mill ground the last curl on the tail of the last
    little pig, the Poor Brother said the magic word, and it
    stopped.</p>

    <p>He did the same thing with crops for his cattle, pretty
    clothes for his daughters, and everything else they wanted. At
    last he had everything he wanted, and so he stood the Little
    Mill behind his door.</p>

    <p>All this time the Rich Brother had been getting more and
    more jealous, and at last he came to ask the Poor Brother how
    he had grown so rich. The Poor Brother told him all about it.
    He said, "It all comes from that Little Mill behind my door.
    All I have to do when I want anything is to name it to the
    Little Mill, and say, 'Grind that, Little Mill, and grind
    quickly,' and the Little Mill will grind that thing
    until&mdash;"</p>

    <p>But the Rich Brother didn't wait to hear any
    <a name="Page_218"
       id="Page_218"></a>more. "Will you lend me the Little Mill?"
       he said.</p>

    <p>"Why, yes," said the Poor Brother, "I will."</p>

    <p>So the Rich Brother took the Little Mill under his arm and
    started across the fields to his house. When he got near home
    he saw the farm-hands coming in from the fields for their
    luncheon. Now, you remember, he was rather mean. He thought to
    himself, "It is a waste of good time for them to come into the
    house; they shall have their porridge where they are." He
    called all the men to him, and made them bring their
    porridge-bowls. Then he set the Little Mill down on the ground,
    and said to it, "Grind oatmeal porridge, Little Mill, and grind
    quickly!" The Little Mill ground, and ground, and ground, and
    out came delicious oatmeal porridge. Each man held his bowl
    under the spout. When the last bowl was filled, the porridge
    ran over on the ground.</p>

    <p>"That's enough, Little Mill," said the Rich Brother. "You
    may stop, and stop quickly."</p>

    <p>But this was not the magic word, and the Little Mill did not
    stop. It ground, and ground, and ground, and the porridge ran
    all round and made a little pool. The Rich Brother said, "No,
    no, Little Mill, I said, 'Stop grinding, and stop quickly.'"
    But the Little Mill ground, and ground, faster than ever; and
    presently there was a regular pond of porridge, almost up to
    <a name="Page_219"
       id="Page_219"></a>their knees. The Rich Brother said, "Stop
       grinding," in every kind of way; he called the Little Mill
       names; but nothing did any good. The Little Mill ground
       porridge just the same. At last the men said, "Go and get
       your brother to stop the Little Mill, or we shall be drowned
       in porridge."</p>

    <p>So the Rich Brother started for his brother's house. He had
    to swim before he got there, and the porridge went up his
    sleeves, and down his neck, and it was horrid and sticky. His
    brother laughed when he heard the story, but he came with him,
    and they took a boat and rowed across the lake of porridge to
    where the Little Mill was grinding. And then the Poor Brother
    whispered the magic word, and the Little Mill stopped.</p>

    <p>But the porridge was a long time soaking into the ground,
    and nothing would ever grow there afterwards except
    oatmeal.</p>

    <p>The Rich Brother didn't seem to care much about the Little
    Mill after this, so the Poor Brother took it home again and put
    it behind the door; and there it stayed a long, long while.</p>

    <p>Years afterwards a Sea Captain came there on a visit. He
    told such big stories that the Poor Brother said, "Oh, I
    daresay you have seen wonderful things, but I don't believe you
    ever saw anything more wonderful than the Little Mill that
    stands behind my door."</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_220"
       id="Page_220"></a>What is wonderful about that?" said the
       Sea Captain.</p>

    <p>"Why," said the Poor Brother, "anything in the world you
    want,&mdash;you have only to name it to the Little Mill and
    say, 'Grind that, Little Mill, and grind quickly,' and it will
    grind that thing until&mdash;"</p>

    <p>The Sea" Captain didn't wait to hear another word. "Will you
    lend me that Little Mill?" he said eagerly.</p>

    <p>The Poor Brother smiled a little, but he said, "Yes," and
    the Sea Captain took the Little Mill under his arm, and went on
    board his ship and sailed away.</p>

    <p>They had head-winds and storms, and they were so long at sea
    that some of the food gave out. Worst of all, the salt gave
    out. It was dreadful, being without salt. But the Captain
    happened to remember the Little Mill.</p>

    <p>"Bring up the salt box!" he said to the cook. "We will have
    salt enough."</p>

    <p>He set the Little Mill on deck, put the salt box under the
    spout, and said,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Grind salt, Little Mill, and grind quickly!"</p>

    <p>And the Little Mill ground beautiful, white, powdery salt.
    When they had enough, the Captain said, "Now you may stop,
    Little Mill, and stop quickly." The Little Mill kept on
    grinding; and the salt began to pile up in little heaps on the
    deck. "I said, 'Stop,'" said the<a name="Page_221"
       id="Page_221"></a> Captain. But the Little Mill ground, and
       ground, faster than ever, and the salt was soon thick on the
       deck like snow. The Captain called the Little Mill names and
       told it to stop, in every language he knew, but the Little
       Mill went on grinding. The salt covered all the decks and
       poured down into the hold, and at last the ship began to
       settle in the water; salt is very heavy. But just before the
       ship sank to the water-line, the Captain had a bright
       thought: he threw the Little Mill overboard!</p>

    <p>It fell right down to the bottom of the sea. <i>And it has
    been grinding salt ever since.</i></p>

    <p>Once upon a time, there was a king and a queen, and they had
    one son, whose name was Billy. And Billy had a bull he was very
    fond of, and the bull was just as fond of him. And when the
    queen came to die, she put it as her last request to the king,
    that come what might, come what may, he'd not part Billy and
    the bull. And the king promised that, come what might,
    <a name="Page_222"
       id="Page_222"></a>come what may, he would not. Then the good
       queen died, and was buried.</p>

    <p>After a time, the king married again, and the new queen
    could not abide Billy; no more could she stand the bull, seeing
    him and Billy so thick. So she asked the king to have the bull
    killed. But the king said he had promised, come what might,
    come what may, he'd not part Billy Beg and his bull, so he
    could not.</p>

    <p>Then the queen sent for the Hen-Wife, and asked what she
    should do. "What will you give me," said the Hen-Wife, "and
    I'll very soon part them?"</p>

    <p>"Anything at all," said the queen.</p>

    <p>"Then do you take to your bed, very sick with a complaint,"
    said the Hen-Wife, "and I'll do the rest."</p>

    <p>So the queen took to her bed, very sick with a complaint,
    and the king came to see what could be done for her. "I shall
    never be better of this," she said, "till I have the medicine
    the Hen-Wife ordered."</p>

    <p>"What is that?" said the king.</p>

    <p>"A mouthful of the blood of Billy Beg's bull."</p>

    <p>"I can't give you that," said the king, and went away,
    sorrowful.</p>

    <p>Then the queen got sicker and sicker, and each time the king
    asked what would cure her she said, "A mouthful of the blood of
    Billy Beg's bull." And at last it looked as if she were going
    <a name="Page_223"
       id="Page_223"></a>to die. So the king finally set a day for
       the bull to be killed. At that the queen was so happy that
       she laid plans to get up and see the grand sight. All the
       people were to be at the killing, and it was to be a great
       affair.</p>

    <p>When Billy Beg heard all this, he was very sorrowful, and
    the bull noticed his looks. "What are you doitherin' about?"
    said the bull to him. So Billy told him. "Don't fret yourself
    about me," said the bull, "it's not I that'll be killed!"</p>

    <p>The day came, when Billy Beg's bull was to be killed; all
    the people were there, and the queen, and Billy. And the bull
    was led out, to be seen. When he was led past Billy he bent his
    head. "Jump on my back, Billy, my boy," says he, "till I see
    what kind of a horseman you are!" Billy jumped on his back, and
    with that the bull leaped nine miles high and nine miles broad
    and came down with Billy sticking between his horns. Then away
    he rushed, over the head of the queen, killing her dead, where
    you wouldn't know day by night or night by day, over high
    hills, low hills, sheep walks and bullock traces, the Cove o'
    Cork, and old Tom Fox with his bugle horn.</p>

    <p>When at last he stopped he said, "Now, Billy, my boy, you
    and I must undergo great scenery; there's a mighty great bull
    of the forest I must fight, here, and he'll be hard to fight,
    but I'll be able for him. But first we must have
    <a name="Page_224"
       id="Page_224"></a>dinner. Put your hand in my left ear and
       pull out the napkin you'll find there, and when you've
       spread it, it will be covered with eating and drinking fit
       for a king."</p>

    <p>So Billy put his hand in the bull's left ear, and drew out
    the napkin, and spread it; and, sure enough, it was spread with
    all kinds of eating and drinking, fit for a king. And Billy Beg
    ate well.</p>

    <p>But just as he finished he heard a great roar, and out of
    the forest came a mighty bull, snorting and running.</p>

    <p>And the two bulls at it and fought. They knocked the hard
    ground into soft, the soft into hard, the rocks into spring
    wells, and the spring wells into rocks. It was a terrible
    fight. But in the end, Billy Beg's bull was too much for the
    other bull, and he killed him, and drank his blood.</p>

    <p>Then Billy jumped on the bull's back, and the bull off and
    away, where you wouldn't know day from night or night from day,
    over high hills, low hills, sheep walks and bullock traces, the
    Cove o' Cork, and old Tom Fox with his bugle horn. And when he
    stopped he told Billy to put his hand in his left ear and pull
    out the napkin, because he'd to fight another great bull of the
    forest. So Billy pulled out the napkin and spread it, and it
    was covered with all kinds of eating and drinking, fit for a
    king.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_225"
       id="Page_225"></a>And, sure enough, just as Billy finished
       eating, there was a frightful roar, and a mighty great bull,
       greater than the first, rushed out of the forest. And the
       two bulls at it and fought. It was a terrible fight! They
       knocked the hard ground into soft, the soft into hard, the
       rocks into spring wells, and the spring wells into rocks.
       But in the end, Billy Beg's bull killed the other bull, and
       drank his blood.</p>

    <p>Then he off and away, with Billy.</p>

    <p>But when he came down, he told Billy Beg that he was to
    fight another bull, the brother of the other two, and that this
    time the other bull would be too much for him, and would kill
    him and drink his blood.</p>

    <p>"When I am dead, Billy, my boy," he said, "put your hand in
    my left ear and draw out the napkin, and you'll never want for
    eating or drinking; and put your hand in my right ear, and
    you'll find a stick there, that will turn into a sword if you
    wave it three times round your head, and give you the strength
    of a thousand men beside your own. Keep that; then cut a strip
    of my hide, for a belt, for when you buckle it on, there's
    nothing can kill you."</p>

    <p>Billy Beg was very sad to hear that his friend must die. And
    very soon he heard a more dreadful roar than ever he heard, and
    a tremendous bull rushed out of the forest. Then came the worst
    fight of all. In the end, the other <a name="Page_226"
       id="Page_226"></a>bull was too much for Billy Beg's bull,
       and he killed him and drank his blood.</p>

    <p>Billy Beg sat down and cried for three days and three
    nights. After that he was hungry; so he put his hand in the
    bull's left ear, and drew out the napkin, and ate all kinds of
    eating and drinking. Then he put his hand in the right ear and
    pulled out the stick which was to turn into a sword if waved
    round his head three times, and to give him the strength of a
    thousand men beside his own. And he cut a strip of the hide for
    a belt, and started off on his adventures.</p>

    <p>Presently he came to a fine place; an old gentleman lived
    there. So Billy went up and knocked, and the old gentleman came
    to the door.</p>

    <p>"Are you wanting a boy?" says Billy.</p>

    <p>"I am wanting a herd-boy," says the gentleman, "to take my
    six cows, six horses, six donkeys, and six goats to pasture
    every morning, and bring them back at night. Maybe you'd
    do."</p>

    <p>"What are the wages?" says Billy.</p>

    <p>"Oh, well," says the gentleman, "it's no use to talk of that
    now; there's three giants live in the wood by the pasture, and
    every day they drink up all the milk and kill the boy that
    looks after the cattle; so we'll wait to talk about wages till
    we see if you come back alive."</p>

    <p>"All right," says Billy, and he entered service with the old
    gentleman.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_227"
       id="Page_227"></a>The first day, he drove the six cows, six
       horses, six donkeys, and six goats to pasture, and sat down
       by them. About noon he heard a kind of roaring from the
       wood; and out rushed a giant with two heads, spitting fire
       out of his two mouths.</p>

    <p>"Oh! my fine fellow," says he to Billy, "you are too big for
    one swallow and not big enough for two; how would you like to
    die, then? By a cut with the sword, a blow with the fist, or a
    swing by the back?"</p>

    <p>"That is as may be," says Billy, "but I'll fight you." And
    he buckled on his hide belt, and swung his stick three times
    round his head, to give him the strength of a thousand men
    besides his own, and went for the giant. And at the first
    grapple Billy Beg lifted the giant up and sunk him in the
    ground, to his armpits.</p>

    <p>"Oh, mercy! mercy! Spare my life!" cried the giant.</p>

    <p>"I think not," said Billy; and he cut off his heads.</p>

    <p>That night, when the cows and the goats were driven home,
    they gave so much milk that all the dishes in the house were
    filled, and the milk ran over and made a little brook in the
    yard.</p>

    <p>"This is very queer," said the old gentleman; "they never
    gave any milk before. Did you see nothing in the pasture?"</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_228"
       id="Page_228"></a>Nothing worse than myself," said Billy.
       And next morning he drove the six cows, six horses, six
       donkeys, and six goats to pasture again.</p>

    <p>Just before noon he heard a terrific roar; and out of the
    wood came a giant with six heads.</p>

    <p>"You killed my brother," he roared, fire coming out of his
    six mouths, "and I'll very soon have your blood! Will you die
    by a cut of the sword, or a swing by the back?"</p>

    <p>"I'll fight you," said Billy. And buckling on his belt and
    swinging his stick three times round his head, he ran in and
    grappled the giant. At the first hold, he sunk the giant up to
    the shoulders in the ground.</p>

    <p>"Mercy, mercy, kind gentleman!" cried the giant. "Spare my
    life!"</p>

    <p>"I think not," said Billy, and cut off his heads.</p>

    <p>That night the cattle gave so much milk that it ran out of
    the house and made a stream, and turned a mill wheel which had
    not been turned for seven years!</p>

    <p>"It's certainly very queer," said the old gentleman; "did
    you see nothing in the pasture, Billy?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing worse than myself," said Billy.</p>

    <p>And the next morning the gentleman said, "Billy, do you
    know, I only heard one of the giants roaring in the night, and
    the night before only two. What can ail them, at all?"</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_229"
       id="Page_229"></a>Oh, maybe they are sick or something,"
       says Billy; and with that he drove the six cows, six horses,
       six donkeys, and six goats to pasture.</p>

    <p>At about ten o'clock there was a roar like a dozen bulls,
    and the brother of the two giants came out of the wood, with
    twelve heads on him, and fire spouting from every one of
    them.</p>

    <p>"I'll have you, my fine boy," cries he; "how will you die,
    then?"</p>

    <p>"We'll see," says Billy; "come on!"</p>

    <p>And swinging his stick round his head, he made for the
    giant, and drove him up to his twelve necks in the ground. All
    twelve of the heads began begging for mercy, but Billy soon cut
    them short. Then he drove the beasts home.</p>

    <p>And that night the milk overflowed the mill-stream and made
    a lake, nine miles long, nine miles broad, and nine miles deep;
    and there are salmon and whitefish there to this day.</p>

    <p>"You are a fine boy," said the gentleman, "and I'll give you
    wages."</p>

    <p>So Billy was herd.</p>

    <p>The next day, his master told him to look after the house
    while he went up to the king's town, to see a great sight.
    "What will it be?" said Billy. "The king's daughter is to be
    eaten by a fiery dragon," said his master, "unless the champion
    fighter they've been feed<a name="Page_230"
       id="Page_230"></a>ing for six weeks on purpose kills the
       dragon." "Oh," said Billy.</p>

    <p>After he was left alone, there were people passing on horses
    and afoot, in coaches and chaises, in carriages and in
    wheelbarrows, all going to see the great sight. And all asked
    Billy why he was not on his way. But Billy said he didn't care
    about going.</p>

    <p>When the last passer-by was out of sight, Billy ran and
    dressed himself in his master's best suit of clothes, took the
    brown mare from the stable, and was off to the king's town.</p>

    <p>When he came there, he saw a big round place with great high
    seats built up around it, and all the people sitting there.
    Down in the midst was the champion, walking up and down
    proudly, with two men behind him to carry his heavy sword. And
    up in the centre of the seats was the princess, with her
    maidens; she was looking very pretty, but nervous.</p>

    <p>The fight was about to begin when Billy got there, and the
    herald was crying out how the champion would fight the dragon
    for the princess's sake, when suddenly there was heard a
    fearsome great roaring, and the people shouted, "Here he is
    now, the dragon!"</p>

    <p>The dragon had more heads than the biggest of the giants,
    and fire and smoke came from every one of them. And when the
    champion saw the creature, he never waited even to take
    <a name="Page_231"
       id="Page_231"></a>his sword,&mdash;he turned and ran; and he
       never stopped till he came to a deep well, where he jumped
       in and hid himself, up to the neck.</p>

    <p>When the princess saw that her champion was gone, she began
    wringing her hands, and crying, "Oh, please, kind gentlemen,
    fight the dragon, some of you, and keep me from being eaten!
    Will no one fight the dragon for me?" But no one stepped up, at
    all. And the dragon made to eat the princess.</p>

    <p>Just then, out stepped Billy from the crowd, with his fine
    suit of clothes and his hide belt on him. "I'll fight the
    beast," he says, and swinging his stick three times round his
    head, to give him the strength of a thousand men besides his
    own, he walked up to the dragon, with easy gait. The princess
    and all the people were looking, you may be sure, and the
    dragon raged at Billy with all his mouths, and they at it and
    fought. It was a terrible fight, but in the end Billy Beg had
    the dragon down, and he cut off his heads with the sword.</p>

    <p>There was great shouting, then, and crying that the strange
    champion must come to the king to be made prince, and to the
    princess, to be seen. But in the midst of the hullabaloo Billy
    Begs slips on the brown mare and is off and away before anyone
    has seen his face. But, quick as he was, he was not so quick
    but that the princess caught hold of him as he jumped
    <a name="Page_232"
       id="Page_232"></a>on his horse, and he got away with one
       shoe left in her hand. And home he rode, to his master's
       house, and had his old clothes on and the mare in the stable
       before his master came back.</p>

    <p>When his master came back, he had a great tale for Billy,
    how the princess's champion had run from the dragon, and a
    strange knight had come out of the clouds and killed the
    dragon, and before anyone could stop him had disappeared in the
    sky. "Wasn't it wonderful?" said the old gentleman to Billy. "I
    should say so," said Billy to him.</p>

    <p>Soon there was proclamation made that the man who killed the
    dragon was to be found, and to be made son of the king and
    husband of the princess; for that, everyone should come up to
    the king's town and try on the shoe which the princess had
    pulled from off the foot of the strange champion, that he whom
    it fitted should be known to be the man. On the day set, there
    was passing of coaches and chaises, of carriages and
    wheelbarrows, people on horseback and afoot, and Billy's master
    was the first to go.</p>

    <p>While Billy was watching, at last came along a raggedy
    man.</p>

    <p>"Will you change clothes with me, and I'll give you boot?"
    said Billy to him.</p>

    <p>"Shame to you to mock a poor raggedy man!" said the raggedy
    man to Billy.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_233"
       id="Page_233"></a>It's no mock," said Billy, and he changed
       clothes with the raggedy man, and gave him boot.</p>

    <p>When Billy came to the king's town, in his dreadful old
    clothes, no one knew him for the champion at all, and none
    would let him come forward to try the shoe. But after all had
    tried, Billy spoke up that he wanted to try. They laughed at
    him, and pushed him back, with his rags. But the princess would
    have it that he should try. "I like his face," said she; "let
    him try, now."</p>

    <p>So up stepped Billy, and put on the shoe, and it fitted him
    like his own skin.</p>

    <p>Then Billy confessed that it was he that killed the dragon.
    And that he was a king's son. And they put a velvet suit on
    him, and hung a gold chain round his neck, and everyone said a
    finer-looking boy they'd never seen.</p>

    <p>So Billy married the princess, and was the prince of that
    place.</p>

    <p>A long way off, across the ocean, there is a little country
    where the ground is lower than the level of the sea, instead of
    higher, as it is here. Of course the water would run in and
    cover the land and houses, if something were <a name="Page_234"
       id="Page_234"></a>not done to keep it out. But something is
       done. The people build great, thick walls all round the
       country, and the walls keep the sea out. You see how much
       depends on those walls,&mdash;the good crops, the houses,
       and even the safety of the people. Even the small children
       in that country know that an accident to one of the walls is
       a terrible thing. These walls are really great banks, as
       wide as roads, and they are called "dikes."</p>

    <p>Once there was a little boy who lived in that country, whose
    name was Hans. One day, he took his little brother out to play.
    They went a long way out of the town, and came to where there
    were no houses, but ever so many flowers and green fields.
    By-and-by, Hans climbed up on the dike, and sat down; the
    little brother was playing about at the foot of the bank.</p>

    <p>Suddenly the little brother called out, "Oh, what a funny
    little hole! It bubbles!"</p>

    <p>"Hole? Where?" said Hans.</p>

    <p>"Here in the bank," said the little brother; "water's in
    it."</p>

    <p>"What!" said Hans, and he slid down as fast as he could to
    where his brother was playing.</p>

    <p>There was the tiniest little hole in the bank. Just an
    air-hole. A drop of water bubbled slowly through.</p>

    <p>"It is a hole in the dike!" cried Hans. "What shall we
    do?"</p>

    <p><a name="Page_235"
       id="Page_235"></a>He looked all round; not a person or a
       house in sight. He looked at the hole; the little drops
       oozed steadily through; he knew that the water would soon
       break a great gap, because that tiny hole gave it a chance.
       The town was so far away&mdash;if they ran for help it would
       be too late; what should he do? Once more he looked; the
       hole was larger, now, and the water was trickling.</p>

    <p>Suddenly a thought came to Hans. He stuck his little
    forefinger right into the hole, where it fitted tight; and he
    said to his little brother, "Run, Dieting! Go to the town and
    tell the men there's a hole in the dike. Tell them I will keep
    it stopped till they get here."</p>

    <p>The little brother knew by Hans' face that something very
    serious was the matter, and he started for the town, as fast as
    his legs could run. Hans, kneeling with his finger in the hole,
    watched him grow smaller and smaller as he got farther
    away.</p>

    <p>Soon he was as small as a chicken; then he was only a speck;
    then he was out of sight. Hans was alone, his finger tight in
    the bank.</p>

    <p>He could hear the water, slap, slap, slap, on the stones;
    and deep down under the slapping was a gurgling, rumbling
    sound. It seemed very near.</p>

    <p>By-and-by, his hand began to feel numb. He rubbed it with
    the other hand; but it got colder <a name="Page_236"
       id="Page_236"></a>and more numb, colder and more numb, every
       minute. He looked to see if the men were coming; the road
       was bare as far as he could see. Then the cold began
       creeping, creeping, up his arm; first his wrist, then his
       arm to the elbow, then his arm to the shoulder; how cold it
       was! And soon it began to ache. Ugly little cramp-pains
       streamed up his finger, up his palm, up his arm, till they
       reached into his shoulder, and down the back of his neck. It
       seemed hours since the little brother went away. He felt
       very lonely, and the hurt in his arm grew and grew. He
       watched the road with all his eyes, but no one came in
       sight. Then he leaned his head against the dike, to rest his
       shoulder.</p>

    <p>As his ear touched the dike, he heard the voice of the great
    sea, murmuring. The sound seemed to say,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I am the great sea. No one can stand against me. What are
    you, a little child, that you try to keep me out? Beware!
    Beware!"</p>

    <p>Hans' heart beat in heavy knocks. Would they never come? He
    was frightened.</p>

    <p>And the water went on beating at the wall, and murmuring, "I
    will come through, I will come through, I will get you, I will
    get you, run&mdash;run&mdash;before I come through!"</p>

    <p>Hans started to pull out his finger; he was so frightened
    that he felt as if he must run for ever.<a name="Page_237"
       id="Page_237"></a> But that minute he remembered how much
       depended on him; if he pulled out his finger, the water
       would surely make the hole bigger, and at last break down
       the dike, and the sea would come in on all the land and
       houses. He set his teeth, and stuck his finger tighter than
       ever.</p>

    <p>"You shall <i>not</i> come through!" he whispered, "I will
    <i>not</i> run!"</p>

    <p>At that moment, he heard a far-off shout. Far in the
    distance he saw a black something on the road, and dust. The
    men were coming! At last, they were coming. They came nearer,
    fast, and he could make out his own father, and the neighbours.
    They had pickaxes and shovels, and they were running. And as
    they ran they shouted, "We're coming; take heart, we're
    coming!"</p>

    <p>The next minute, it seemed, they were there. And when they
    saw Hans, with his pale face, and his hand tight in the dike,
    they gave a great cheer,&mdash;just as people do for soldiers
    back from war; and they lifted him up and rubbed his aching arm
    with tender hands, and they told him that he was a real hero
    and that he had saved the town.</p>

    <p>When the men had mended the dike, they marched home like an
    army, and Hans was carried high on their shoulders, because he
    was a hero. And to this day the people of Haarlem tell the
    story of how a little boy saved the dike.</p>

    <p>Little Franz didn't want to go to school, that morning. He
    would much rather have played truant. The air was so warm and
    still,&mdash;you could hear the blackbird singing at the edge
    of the wood, and the sound of the Prussians drilling, down in
    the meadow behind the old sawmill. He would <i>so</i> much
    rather have played truant! Besides, this was the day for the
    lesson in the rule of participles; and the rule of participles
    in French is very, very long, and very hard, and it has more
    exceptions than rule. Little Franz did not know it at all. He
    did not want to go to school.</p>

    <p>But, somehow, he went. His legs carried him reluctantly into
    the village and along the street. As he passed the official
    bulletin-board before the town hall, he noticed a little crowd
    round it, looking at it. That was the place where the news of
    lost battles, the requisition for more troops, the demands for
    new taxes were posted. Small as he was, little Franz had seen
    enough to make him think, "What <i>now</i>, I wonder?" But he
    could not stop to see; he was afraid of being late.</p>

    <p>When he came to the school-yard his heart beat very fast; he
    was afraid he <i>was</i> late, after all, for the windows were
    all open, and yet he <a name="Page_239"
       id="Page_239"></a>heard no noise,&mdash;the schoolroom was
       perfectly quiet. He had been counting on the noise and
       confusion before school,&mdash;the slamming of desk covers,
       the banging of books, the tapping of the master's cane and
       his "A little less noise, please,"&mdash;to let him slip
       quietly into his seat unnoticed. But no; he had to open the
       door and walk up the long aisle, in the midst of a silent
       room, with the master looking straight at him. Oh, how hot
       his cheeks felt, and how hard his heart beat! But to his
       great surprise the master didn't scold at all. All he said
       was, "Come quickly to your place, my little Franz; we were
       just going to begin without you!"</p>

    <p>Little Franz could hardly believe his ears; that wasn't at
    all the way the master was accustomed to speak. It was very
    strange! Somehow&mdash;everything was very strange. The room
    looked queer. Everybody was sitting so still, so
    straight&mdash;as if it were an exhibition day, or something
    very particular. And the master&mdash;he looked strange, too;
    why, he had on his fine lace jabot and his best coat, that he
    wore only on holidays, and his gold snuff-box in his hand.
    Certainly it was very odd. Little Franz looked all round,
    wondering. And there in the back of the room was the oddest
    thing of all. There, on a bench, sat <i>visitors</i>. Visitors!
    He could not make it out; people never came except on great
    occasions,&mdash;examination days and such. And it
    <a name="Page_240"
       id="Page_240"></a>was not a holiday. Yet there were the
       agent, the old blacksmith, the farmer, sitting quiet and
       still. It was very, very strange.</p>

    <p>Just then the master stood up and opened school. He said,
    "My children, this is the last time I shall ever teach you. The
    order has come from Berlin that henceforth nothing but German
    shall be taught in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. This is
    your last lesson in French. I beg you, be very attentive."</p>

    <p><i>His last lesson in French!</i> Little Franz could not
    believe his ears; his last lesson&mdash;ah, <i>that</i> was
    what was on the bulletin-board! It flashed across him in an
    instant. That was it! His last lesson in French&mdash;and he
    scarcely knew how to read and write&mdash;why, then, he should
    never know how! He looked down at his books, all battered and
    torn at the corners; and suddenly his books seemed quite
    different to him, they seemed&mdash;somehow&mdash;like friends.
    He looked at the master, and he seemed different,
    too,&mdash;like a very good friend. Little Franz began to feel
    strange himself. Just as he was thinking about it, he heard his
    name called, and he stood up to recite.</p>

    <p>It was the rule of participles.</p>

    <p>Oh, what wouldn't he have given to be able to say it off
    from beginning to end, exceptions and all, without a blunder!
    But he could only stand and hang his head; he did not know a
    <a name="Page_241"
       id="Page_241"></a>word of it. Then through the hot pounding
       in his ears he heard the master's voice; it was quite
       gentle; not at all the scolding voice he expected. And it
       said, "I'm not going to punish you, little Franz. Perhaps
       you are punished enough. And you are not alone in your
       fault. We all do the same thing,&mdash;we all put off our
       tasks till to-morrow. And&mdash;sometimes&mdash;to-morrow
       never comes. That is what it has been with us. We Alsatians
       have been always putting off our education till the morrow;
       and now they have a right, those people down there, to say
       to us, 'What! You call yourselves French, and cannot even
       read and write the French language? Learn German,
       then!'"</p>

    <p>And then the master spoke to them of the French language. He
    told them how beautiful it was, how clear and musical and
    reasonable, and he said that no people could be hopelessly
    conquered so long as it kept its language, for the language was
    the key to its prison-house. And then he said he was going to
    tell them a little about that beautiful language, and he
    explained the rule of participles.</p>

    <p>And do you know, it was just as simple as ABC! Little Franz
    understood every word. It was just the same with the rest of
    the grammar lesson. I don't know whether little Franz listened
    harder, or whether the master explained better; but it was all
    quite clear, and simple.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_242"
       id="Page_242"></a>But as they went on with it, and little
       Franz listened and looked, it seemed to him that the master
       was trying to put the whole French language into their heads
       in that one hour. It seemed as if he wanted to teach them
       all he knew, before he went,&mdash;to give them all he
       had,&mdash;in this last lesson.</p>

    <p>From the grammar he went on to the writing lesson. And for
    this, quite new copies had been prepared. They were written on
    clean, new slips of paper, and they were:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;France: Alsace.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;France: Alsace.<br /></p>

    <p>All up and down the aisles they hung out from the desks like
    little banners, waving:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;France: Alsace.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;France: Alsace.<br /></p>

    <p>And everybody worked with all his might,&mdash;not a sound
    could you hear but the scratching of pens on the "France:
    Alsace."</p>

    <p>Even the little ones bent over their up and down strokes
    with their tongues stuck out to help them work.</p>

    <p>After the writing came the reading lesson, and the little
    ones sang their <i>ba</i>, <i>be</i>, <i>bi</i>, <i>bo</i>,
    <i>bu</i>.</p>

    <p>Right in the midst of it, Franz heard a curious sound, a big
    deep voice mingling with the children's voices. He turned
    round, and there, on the bench in the back of the room, the old
    <a name="Page_243"
       id="Page_243"></a>blacksmith sat with a big ABC book open on
       his knees. It was his voice Franz had heard. He was saying
       the sounds with the little children,&mdash;<i>ba</i>,
       <i>be</i>, <i>bi</i>, <i>bo</i>, <i>bu</i>. His voice
       sounded so odd, with the little voices,&mdash;so very
       odd,&mdash;it made little Franz feel queer. It seemed so
       funny that he thought he would laugh; then he thought he
       wouldn't laugh, he felt&mdash;he felt very queer.</p>

    <p>So it went on with the lessons; they had them all. And then,
    suddenly, the town clock struck noon. And at the same time they
    heard the tramp of the Prussians' feet, coming back from
    drill.</p>

    <p>It was time to close school.</p>

    <p>The master stood up. He was very pale. Little Franz had
    never seen him look so tall. He said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"My children&mdash;my children"&mdash;but something choked
    him; he could not go on. Instead he turned and went to the
    blackboard and took up a piece of chalk. And then he wrote,
    high up, in big white letters, "Vive la France!"</p>

    <p>And he made a little sign to them with his head, "That is
    all; go away."</p>

    <p>There was once a nation which was very powerful, very
    fortunate, and very proud. Its <a name="Page_244"
       id="Page_244"></a>lands were fruitful; its armies were
       victorious in battle; and it had strong kings, wise
       lawgivers, and great poets. But after a great many years,
       everything changed. The nation had no more strong kings, no
       more wise lawgivers; its armies were beaten in battle, and
       neighbouring tribes conquered the country and took the
       fruitful lands; there were no more poets except a few who
       made songs of lamentation. The people had become a captive
       and humiliated people; and the bitterest part of all its
       sadness was the memory of past greatness.</p>

    <p>But in all the years of failure and humiliation, there was
    one thing which kept this people from despair; one hope lived
    in their hearts and kept them from utter misery. It was a hope
    which came from something one of the great poets of the past
    had said, in prophecy. This prophecy was whispered in the homes
    of the poor, taught in the churches, repeated from father to
    son among the rich; it was like a deep, hidden well of comfort
    in a desert of suffering. The prophecy said that some time a
    deliverer should be born for the nation, a new king even
    stronger than the old ones, mighty enough to conquer its
    enemies, set it free, and bring back the splendid days of old.
    This was the hope and expectation all the people looked for;
    they waited through the years for the prophecy to come
    true.</p>

    <p>In this nation, in a little country town, lived
    <a name="Page_245"
       id="Page_245"></a>a man and a woman whose names were Joseph
       and Mary. And it happened, one year, that they had to take a
       little journey up to the town which was the nearest
       tax-centre, to have their names put on the census list;
       because that was the custom in that country.</p>

    <p>But when they got to the town, so many others were there for
    the same thing, and it was such a small town, that every place
    was crowded. There was no room for them at the inn. Finally,
    the innkeeper said they might sleep in the stable, on the
    straw. So they went there for the night.</p>

    <p>And while they were there, in the stable, their first child
    was born to them, a little son. And because there was no cradle
    to put Him in, the mother made a little warm nest of the hay in
    the big wooden manger where the oxen had eaten, and wrapped the
    baby in swaddling clothes, and laid Him in the manger, for a
    bed!</p>

    <p>That same night, on the hills outside the town, there were
    shepherds, keeping their flocks through the darkness. They were
    tired with watching over the sheep, and they stood or sat
    about, drowsily, talking and watching the stars. And as they
    watched, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto them! And
    the glory of the Lord shone round about them! And they were
    sore afraid. But the angel said <a name="Page_246"
       id="Page_246"></a>unto them, "Fear not, for behold I bring
       you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
       <i>For unto you is born, this day, in the city of David, a
       saviour,&mdash;which is Christ the Lord.</i> And this shall
       be a sign unto you: ye shall find the babe, wrapped in
       swaddling clothes, <i>lying in a manger</i>."</p>

    <p>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
    heavenly host, praising God, and saying, "Glory to God in the
    highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."</p>

    <p>When the angels were gone up from them into heaven, the
    shepherds said to one another, "Let us now go even unto
    Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the
    Lord hath made known unto us." And they came, with haste, and
    they found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
    And when they saw Him in the manger, they knew that the
    wonderful thing the angel said had really happened, and that
    the great deliverer was born at last.</p>

    <p>"It is the grown people who make the nursery stories," wrote
    Stevenson, "all the children do is jealously to preserve the
    text." And the grown person, whether he makes his stories with
    pen or with tongue, should bring two qualities at least to the
    work&mdash;simplicity of language and a serious sincerity. The
    reason for the simplicity is obvious, for no one, child or
    otherwise, can thoroughly enjoy a story clouded by words which
    convey no meaning to him.</p>

    <p>The second quality is less obvious but equally necessary. No
    absence of fun is intended by the words "serious sincerity,"
    but they mean that the story-teller should bring to the child
    an equal interest in what is about to be told; an honest
    acceptance, for the time being, of the fairies, or the heroes,
    or the children, or the animals who talk, with which the tale
    is concerned. The child deserves this equality of standpoint,
    and without it there can be no entire success.</p>

    <p>As for the stories themselves, the difficulty lies with the
    material, not with the <i>child</i>. Styles may be varied
    generously, but the matter must <a name="Page_248"
       id="Page_248"></a>be quarried for. Out of a hundred
       children's books it is more than likely that ninety-nine
       will be useless; yet perhaps out of one autobiography may be
       gleaned an anecdote, or a reminiscence which can be
       amplified into an absorbing tale. Almost every story-teller
       will find that the open eye and ear will serve him better
       than much arduous searching. No one book will yield him the
       increase to his repertoire which will come to him by
       listening, by browsing in chance volumes and magazines, and
       even newspapers, by observing everyday life, and in all
       remembering his own youth, and his youthful, waiting
       audience.</p>

    <p>And that youthful audience? A rather too common mistake is
    made in allowing overmuch for the creative imagination of the
    normal child. It is not creative imagination which the normal
    child possesses so much as an enormous credulity and no
    limitations. If we consider for a moment we see that there has
    been little or nothing to limit things for him, therefore
    anything is possible. It is the years of our life as they come
    which narrow our fancies and set a bound to our beliefs; for
    experience has taught us that for the most part a certain cause
    will produce a certain effect. The child, on the contrary, has
    but little knowledge of causes, and as yet but an imperfect
    realisation of effects. If we, for instance, go into the midst
    of a savage country, we know that there is the chance of
    <a name="Page_249"
       id="Page_249"></a>our meeting a savage. But to the young
       child it is quite as possible to meet a Red Indian coming
       round the bend of the brook at the bottom of the orchard, as
       it is to meet him in his own wigwam.</p>

    <p>The child is an adept at make-believe, but his make-believes
    are, as a rule, practical and serious. It is credulity rather
    than imagination which helps him. He takes the tales he has
    been <i>told</i>, the facts he has observed, and for the most
    part reproduces them to the best of his ability. And "nothing,"
    as Stevenson says, "can stagger a child's faith; he accepts the
    clumsiest substitutes and can swallow the most staring
    incongruities. The chair he has just been besieging as a castle
    is taken away for the accommodation of a morning visitor and he
    is nothing abashed; he can skirmish by the hour with a
    stationary coal-scuttle; in the midst of the enchanted
    pleasuance he can see, without sensible shock, the gardener
    soberly digging potatoes for the day's dinner."</p>

    <p>The child, in fact, is neither undeveloped "grown-up" nor
    unspoiled angel. Perhaps he has a dash of both, but most of all
    he is akin to the grown person who dreams. With the dreamer and
    with the child there is that unquestioning acceptance of
    circumstances as they arise, however unusual and disconcerting
    they may be. In dreams the wildest, most improbable and
    fantastic things happen, but they are <a name="Page_250"
       id="Page_250"></a>not so to the dreamer. The veriest cynic
       amongst us must take his dreams seriously and without a
       sneer, whether he is forced to leap from the edge of a
       precipice, whether he finds himself utterly incapable of
       packing his trunk in time for the train, whether in spite of
       his distress at the impropriety, he finds himself at a
       dinner-party minus his collar, or whether the riches of El
       Dorado are laid at his feet. For him at the time it is all
       quite real and harassingly or splendidly important.</p>

    <p>To the child and to the dreamer all things are possible;
    frogs may talk, bears may be turned into princes, gallant
    tailors may overcome giants, fir-trees may be filled with
    ambitions. A chair may become a horse, a chest of drawers a
    coach and six, a hearthrug a battlefield, a newspaper a crown
    of gold. And these are facts which the story-teller must
    realise, and choose and shape the stories accordingly.</p>

    <p>Many an old book, which to a modern grown person may seem
    prim and over-rigid, will be to the child a delight; for him
    the primness and the severity slip away, the story remains.
    Such a book as Mrs Sherwood's <i>Fairchild Family</i> is an
    example of this. To a grown person reading it for the first
    time, the loafing propensities of the immaculate Mrs Fairchild,
    who never does a hand's turn of good work for anyone from cover
    to cover, the hard piety, the <a name="Page_251"
       id="Page_251"></a>snobbishness, the brutality of taking the
       children to the old gallows and seating them before the
       dangling remains of a murderer, while the lesson of
       brotherly love is impressed are shocking when they are not
       amusing; but to the child the doings of the naughty and
       repentant little Fairchilds are engrossing; and experience
       proves to us that the twentieth-century child is as eager
       for the book as were ever his nineteenth-century grandfather
       and grandmother.</p>

    <p>Good Mrs Timmin's <i>History of the Robins</i>, too, is a
    continuous delight; and from its pompous and high-sounding
    dialogue a skilful adapter may glean not only one story, but
    one story with two versions; for the infant of eighteen months
    can follow the narrative of the joys and troubles, errors and
    kindnesses of Robin, Dicky, Flopsy and Pecksy; while the child
    of five or ten or even more will be keenly interested in a
    fuller account of the birds' adventures and the development of
    their several characters and those of their human friends and
    enemies.</p>

    <p>From these two books, from Miss Edgeworth's wonderful
    <i>Moral Tales</i>; from Miss Wetherell's delightful volume
    <i>Mr Rutherford's Children</i>; from Jane and Ann Taylor's
    <i>Original Poems</i>; from Thomas Day's <i>Sandford and
    Merton</i>; from Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> and Lamb's
    <i>Tales from Shakespeare</i>, and from many another old
    <a name="Page_252"
       id="Page_252"></a>friend, stories may be gathered, but the
       story-teller will find that in almost all cases adaptation
       is a necessity. The joy of the hunt, however, is a real joy,
       and with a field which stretches from the myths of Greece to
       <i>Uncle Remus</i>, from <i>Le Morte d'Arthur</i> to the
       <i>Jungle Books</i>, there need be no more lack of pleasure
       for the seeker than for the receiver of the spoil.</p>

Original Etext produced by Charles Keller.  Merged with new
transcription by Michael Ciesielski, Melissa Er-Raqabi and the Online
Distributed Proofreading Team.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
